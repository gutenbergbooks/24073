    <h2>
      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Irish police barrack is invariably clean, occasionally picturesque,
      but it is never comfortable. The living-room, in which the men spend their
      spare time, is furnished with rigid simplicity. There is a table,
      sometimes two tables, but they have iron legs. There are benches to sit
      on, very narrow, and these also have iron legs. Iron is, of course, harder
      than wood. Men who are forced to look at it and rub their legs against it
      at meal times are likely to obtain a stern, martial spirit. Wood, even
      oak, might in the long run have an enervating effect on their minds. The
      Government knows this, and if it were possible to have tables and benches
      with iron tops as well as iron legs police barracks in Ireland would be
      furnished with them. On the walls of the living-room are stands for arms.
      Here are ranged the short carbines with which, in extreme emergencies, the
      police shoot at the other inhabitants of Ireland. The sight of these
      weapons serves to remind the men that they form a military force.
    </p>
    <p>
      Near the carbines hang a few pairs of handcuffs, unobtrusively, because no
      one wants to emphasize the fact that the police in Ireland have to deal
      with ordinary wrong doers as well as with turbulent mobs. Ornament of
      every kind is rigorously excluded from these rooms. It is all very well to
      aim at the development of the aesthetic faculty for children by putting
      pictures and scraggy geraniums in pots into schoolrooms. No one wants a
      policeman to be artistic. But the love of the beautiful breaks out
      occasionally, even in policemen who live in barracks. Constable Moriarty,
      for instance, had a passion for music. He whistled better than any man in
      Ballymoy, and spent much of his leisure in working up thrilling variations
      of popular tunes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being confined by the call of duty to the living-room of the barrack in
      Ballymoy for a whole morning, he had accomplished a series of runs and
      trills through which the air of &ldquo;The Minstrel Boy&rdquo; seemed to struggle for
      expression. His attention was fixed on this composition, and not at all on
      the newspaper which lay across his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      At twelve o&rsquo;clock he rose from the bench on which he was sitting and
      allowed the newspaper to fall in a crumpled heap on the floor at his feet.
      He stretched himself and yawned. Then he glanced round the barrack-room
      with an air of weariness. Sergeant Colgan, his tunic unbuttoned, his grey
      flannel shirt open at the neck, dozed uncomfortably in a corner. Moriarty
      looked at him enviously. The sergeant was much the older man of the two,
      and was besides of portly figure. Sleep came easily to him under the most
      unpromising circumstances. Moriarty was not more than twenty four years of
      age. He was mentally and physically an active man. Before he went to work
      on &ldquo;The Minstrel Boy&rdquo; he had wooed sleep in vain. Even a three days&rsquo; old
      copy of the <i>Weekly Freeman</i> had brought him no more than a series of
      stupefying yawns. If a man cannot go to sleep over a back number of a
      weekly paper there is no use his trying to go to sleep at all. He may as
      well whistle tunes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moriarty left the living-room in which the sergeant slept and went out to
      the door of the barrack. He stared across the market square. The sun shone
      pitilessly. Except for a fat white dog, which lay asleep in the gutter
      opposite the shop of Kerrigan, the butcher, no living thing was to be
      seen. Hot days are so rare in west of Ireland towns that the people
      succumb to them at once. Business, unless it happens to be market day,
      absolutely ceases in a town like Ballymoy when the thermometer registers
      anything over eighty degrees. Moriarty stretched himself again and yawned.
      He looked at the illustrated poster which hung on a board beside the
      barrack door. It proclaimed the attractiveness of service in the British
      army. It moved him to no interest, because he had seen it every day since
      he first came to Ballymoy. The gaudy uniforms depicted on it excited no
      envy in his mind. His own uniform was of sober colouring, but it taught
      him all he wanted to know about the discomfort of such clothes in hot
      weather. His eyes wandered from the poster and remained fixed for some
      time on the front of the office of the <i>Connacht Advocate</i>. The door
      was shut and the window blind was pulled down. An imaginative man might
      have pictured Mr. Thaddeus Gallagher, the editor, penning ferocious
      attacks upon landlords at his desk inside, or demonstrating, in spite of
      the high temperature, the desperate wickedness of all critics of the Irish
      Party. But Moriarty was by temperament a realist. He suspected that
      Thaddeus Gallagher, divested of his coat and waistcoat, was asleep, with
      his feet on the office table. Next to the newspaper office was the
      Imperial Hotel, owned and managed by Mr. Doyle. Its door was open, so that
      any one with sufficient energy for such activity might go in and get a
      drink at the bar. Moriarty gazed at the front of the hotel for a long
      time, so long that the glare of light reflected from its whitewashed walls
      brought water to his eyes. Then he turned and looked into the barrack
      again. Beside him, just outside the door of the living-room, hung a small
      framed notice, which stated that Constable Moriarty was on guard. He
      looked at it. Then he peeped into the living-room and satisfied himself
      that the sergeant was still sound asleep. It was exceedingly unlikely that
      Mr. Gregg, the District Inspector of the Police, would visit the barrack
      on such a very hot day. Moriarty buttoned his tunic, put his forage cap on
      his head, and stepped out of the barrack.
    </p>
    <p>
      He crossed the square towards Doyle&rsquo;s Hotel. A hostile critic of the Royal
      Irish Constabulary&mdash;and there are such critics even of this excellent
      body of men&mdash;might have suspected Moriarty of adventuring in search
      of a drink. The great heat of the day and the extreme dulness of keeping
      guard over a barrack which no one ever attacks might have excused a
      longing for bottled porter. It would have been unfair to blame Moriarty if
      he had entered the bar of the hotel and wakened Mr. Doyle. But he did no
      more than glance through the open door. He satisfied himself that Mr.
      Doyle, like the sergeant and Mr. Thaddeus Gallagher, was sound asleep.
      Then he passed on and turned down a narrow laneway at the side of the
      hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      This led him into the yard at the back of the hotel. A man of delicate
      sensibilities would have shrunk from entering Mr. Doyle&rsquo;s yard on a hot
      day. It was exceedingly dirty, and there were a great many decaying things
      all over it, besides a manure heap in one corner and a pig-stye in
      another. But Constable Moriarty had no objection to bad smells. He sat
      down on the low wall of the pig-stye and whistled &ldquo;Kathleen Mavourneen.&rdquo;
       He worked through the tune twice creditably, but without attempting
      variations. He was just beginning it a third time when a door at the back
      of the hotel opened and a girl came out. Moriarty stopped whistling and
      grinned at her amiably. She was a very pretty girl, but she was nearly as
      dirty as the yard. Her short skirt was spotted and stained from waist-band
      to the ragged fringe where there had once been a hem. Her boots were caked
      with dry mud. They were several sizes too large for her and seemed likely
      to fall off when she lifted her feet from the ground. A pink cotton blouse
      was untidily fastened at her neck with a brass safety pin. Her hair hung
      in a thick pig-tail down her back. In the higher ranks of society in
      Connacht, as elsewhere, girls are generally anxious to pose as young women
      at the earliest possible moment. They roll up their hair and fasten it
      with hairpins as soon as their mothers allow them. But girls of the
      peasant class in the west of Ireland put off the advance of womanhood as
      long as they can. Wiser than their more fashionable sisters, they dread
      the cares and responsibilities of adult life. Up to the age of twenty,
      twenty-one, or twenty-two, they still wear their hair in pig-tails and
      keep their skirts above their ankles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that you, Mary Ellen?&rdquo; said Constable Moriarty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl stood still. She was carrying a bucket full of a thick yellow
      liquid in her right hand. She allowed it to rest against her leg. A small
      portion of its contents slopped over and still further stained her skirt.
      She looked at Constable Moriarty out of the corners of her eyes for a
      moment. Then she went on again towards the pig-stye. She had large brown
      eyes with thick lashes. Her hair was still in a pig-tail, and her skirt
      was far from covering the tops of her boots; but she had a precocious
      understanding of the art of looking at a man out of the corners of her
      eyes. Moriarty was agreeably thrilled by her glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it the pig you&rsquo;re going to feed?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said Mary Ellen.
    </p>
    <p>
      A very chivalrous man, or one trained in the conventions of what is called
      polite society, might have left his seat on the wall and helped the girl
      to carry the bucket across the yard. Moriarty did neither the one nor the
      other. Mary Ellen did not expect that he would. It was her business and
      not his to feed the pigs. Besides, the bucket was very full. That its
      contents should stain her dress did not matter. It would have been a much
      more serious thing if any of the yellow slop had trickled down Constable
      Moriarty&rsquo;s beautiful trousers.
    </p>
    <p>
      She reached the pig-stye, lifted the bucket, and tipped the contents into
      a wooden trough. Constable Moriarty, still seated on the wall, watched her
      admiringly. Her sleeves were rolled up above the elbows. She had very
      well-shaped, plump, brown arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s many a man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;might be glad enough to be that pig.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary Ellen looked up at him with an air of innocent astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why would he then?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The way he&rsquo;d have you bringing his dinner to him,&rdquo; said Moriarty.
    </p>
    <p>
      This compliment must have been very gratifying to Mary Ellen, but she made
      no reply to it. She set down the empty bucket on the ground and rubbed her
      hands slowly on the sides of her skirt Moriarty probably felt that he had
      done as much as could be expected of him in the way of pretty speeches. He
      whistled &ldquo;Kathleen Mavourneen&rdquo; through once while Mary Ellen wiped her
      hands dry. She picked up her bucket again and turned to go away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me this now,&rdquo; said Moriarty. &ldquo;Did ever you have your fortune told?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m good at,&rdquo; said Moriarty, &ldquo;is telling fortunes. There was an
      aunt of mine one time that was terrible skilful at it. It was her taught
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity she had no more sense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you was to sit up on the wall beside me,&rdquo; said Moriarty, &ldquo;and if you
      was to lend me the loan of your hand for one minute&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get out,&rdquo; said Mary Ellen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d be surprised, so you would,&rdquo; said Moriarty, &ldquo;at the things I&rsquo;d tell
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I won&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; said Mary Ellen, &ldquo;for I&rsquo;ve more to do than to be
      listening to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the hurry?&rdquo; said Moriarty. &ldquo;Sure the day&rsquo;s long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The affair might have ended in a manner pleasant to Moriarty and
      interesting to the pig. The attraction of the occult would in all
      probability have overcome Mary Ellen&rsquo;s maidenly suspicions. She might not
      have sat upon the wall. She would have almost certainly have yielded her
      sticky hand if a sudden sound had not startled Moriarty. A motor-car
      hooted at the far end of the village street. Moriarty jumped off the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one of them motor-cars,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and the fellow that&rsquo;s in her
      will be stopping at the barrack for to ask his way to somewhere. It&rsquo;s a
      curious thing, so it is, that them motor drivers never knows the way to
      the place they&rsquo;re going to, and it&rsquo;s always the police they ask, as if the
      police had nothing to do but to attend to them. I&rsquo;ll have to be off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He left the yard, hurried down the narrow lane, and crossed the road to
      the barrack. Just as he reached it the car, a large, opulent-looking
      vehicle, stopped outside Doyle&rsquo;s Hotel. Moriarty went into the barrack and
      wakened the sergeant. He had a keen sense of his duty towards his superior
      officer. It would not have been kind or right to allow the sergeant to
      sleep through an event so unusual as the stopping of a handsome motor
      outside the door of the Imperial Hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The car was a large one, but it carried only a single traveller. He was a
      lean, sharp-faced man, clean shaven, with very piercing hard grey eyes. He
      blew three blasts on the horn of his motor. Then Mr. Doyle came out of the
      door. He blinked irritably at the stranger. The strong sunlight affected
      his eyes, and the rude way in which he had been awakened from his sleep
      overcame for a moment the natural instinct of the hotel keeper. All hotel
      keepers are civil to possible guests. Otherwise they would not succeed in
      their business. Mr. Doyle knew this, but he scarcely realised at first
      that the gentleman in the motor-car might be a guest. His was not a
      tourist&rsquo;s hotel and he had been very sound asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say,&rdquo; said the stranger, &ldquo;are you the proprietor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; said Doyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I register?&rdquo; said the motorist.
    </p>
    <p>
      The word was strange to Doyle, Guests at his hotel were very few. A
      commercial traveller stopped a night with him occasionally, trying to push
      the sale of drapery goods or boots in Ballymoy. An official of a minor
      kind, an instructor in agriculture, or a young lady sent out to better the
      lot of domestic fowls, was stranded now and then in Ballymoy and therefore
      obliged to spend the night in Doyle&rsquo;s hotel. But such chance strangers
      merely asked for rooms and food. They did not want to &ldquo;register.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you what?&rdquo; said Doyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Register,&rdquo; said the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know can you,&rdquo; said Doyle. &ldquo;This is a backward place, but you
      might try them at the police barrack. The sergeant&rsquo;s an obliging man, and
      if the thing can be done I wouldn&rsquo;t doubt but he&rsquo;d do it for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t kind of catch on to my meaning,&rdquo; said the stranger. &ldquo;What I
      want is to stop a day or two in your hotel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doyle suddenly realised the possibilities of the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can do that of course,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and welcome. I&rsquo;d be glad if we had
      a gentleman like yourself every day of the week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned as he spoke and shouted for Mary Ellen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Business pretty stagnant?&rdquo; said the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may say that. Mary Ellen, Mary Ellen! Come here, I say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stranger got out of his car. He looked up and down the empty street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;since I travelled in this slumbrous old country of
      yours I&rsquo;ve seen considerable stagnation, but this licks the worst I&rsquo;ve
      struck yet. Your town pretty well fathoms the depths. Are the folks here
      alive at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doyle looked round him as he spoke. He saw a good deal that the stranger
      missed. Sergeant Colgan and Constable Moriarty standing well back inside
      the barrack door, were visible, dim figures in the shadow, keenly alert,
      surveying the stranger. Young Kerrigan, the butcher&rsquo;s son, crouched, half
      concealed, behind the body of a dead sheep which hung from a hook outside
      the door of his father&rsquo;s shop. He too was watching. One side of the window
      blind of the <i>Connacht Eagle</i> office was pulled aside. Thaddeus
      Gallagher was without doubt peering at the motor-car through a corner of
      the window. Three small boys were lurking among the packing cases which
      stood outside a shop further down the street. Doyle felt justified in
      repeating his statement that many of the inhabitants of Ballymoy were
      alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;many a one that&rsquo;s alive enough, though I don&rsquo;t say
      but that business might be brighter. Mary Ellen, I say, come here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary Ellen appeared at the door of the hotel. She had improved her
      appearance slightly by putting on an apron. But she had not found time to
      wash her face. This was not her fault. Washing is a serious business. In
      Mary Ellen&rsquo;s case it would have taken a long time if it were to be in the
      least effective. Doyle&rsquo;s call was urgent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you come when you heard me calling you?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary Ellen looked at him with a gentle tolerant smile. She belonged to a
      race which had discovered the folly of being in a hurry about anything.
      She knew that Doyle was not really in a hurry, though he pretended to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amn&rsquo;t I coming?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she looked at the stranger. He, being a stranger and apparently a man
      of some other nation, might perhaps really be in a hurry. Such people
      sometimes are. But his eccentricities in no way mattered to Mary Ellen.
      The wisdom of the ages was hers. The Irish have it. So have eastern
      peoples. They will survive when the fussy races have worn themselves out.
      She gave the stranger one glance of half contemptuous pity and then looked
      at the motorcar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now that you are here,&rdquo; said Doyle severely, &ldquo;will you make yourself
      useful?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary Ellen stared at the motor-car. Her beautiful brown eyes opened very
      wide. Her mouth opened slightly and expanded in a smile. A long line of
      the black transferred from the kitchen kettle to her cheek reached from
      her ear to the point of her chin. It was broken as her smile broadened and
      finally part of it was lost in the hollow of a dimple which appeared. Mary
      Ellen had never before seen so splendid a motor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you stop grinning,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;and take the gentleman&rsquo;s things
      into the house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name,&rdquo; said the stranger, &ldquo;is Billing, Horace P. Billing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you hear that now?&rdquo; said Doyle to Mary Ellen.
    </p>
    <p>
      She approached the motor-car cautiously, still smiling. Mr. Billing handed
      out two bags and then a photographic camera with tripod legs, strapped
      together. Doyle took one of the bags. Mary Ellen took the other. Mr.
      Billing himself carried the camera.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It occurs to me,&rdquo; said Mr. Billing, &ldquo;that this town kind of cries out to
      be wakened up a bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;but it might be the better of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary Ellen turned round and looked at Mr. Billing. She felt that he was
      likely, if he were really bent on waking up the town, to begin with her.
      It did not please her to be wakened up. She looked at Mr. Billing
      anxiously. She wanted to know whether he were the kind of man who would be
      able to rouse her to unusual activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where I come from,&rdquo; said Mr. Billing, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m reckoned to hustle quite
      considerable. I&rsquo;d rather like to try if I could get a move on your
      folks.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can try,&rdquo; said Doyle. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be glad if you&rsquo;d try, for the place wants
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No harm could possibly come of the effort; and it was likely to occupy Mr.
      Billing for several days. The prospect was gratifying to Doyle. A guest
      who travelled in a very large motor-car might be made to pay heavily for
      his rooms and his meals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five small boys came out of different houses up and down the street. When
      Mr. Billing, Doyle and Mary Ellen entered the hotel the boys drifted
      together towards the motor-car. They walked all round it. They peered
      cautiously into it. The boldest of them prodded the tyres with his
      fingers. The window of the office of the <i>Connacht Eagle</i> was opened,
      and Mr. Thaddeus Gallagher looked out Young Kerrigan emerged from the
      shelter of the body of the dead sheep and stood outside the shop. His
      father joined him. Both of them stared at the motor-car. Sergeant Colgan,
      followed by Constable Moriarty, stepped out of the police barrack and
      stalked majestically across the street. The sergeant frowned heavily at
      the small boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be off out of that, every one of yez,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The small boys retreated at once. The law, in spite of all that is said to
      the contrary, is greatly respected in the west of Ireland. Sergeant Colgan
      would have made it respected anywhere. His appearance was far more
      impressive than that of any judge in his robes of office. Constable
      Moriarty, who was more than six feet high, was impressive too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fine car,&rdquo; said the sergeant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said Moriarty, &ldquo;as fine a one as ever I seen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man that owns it will be a high up man,&rdquo; said the sergeant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will,&rdquo; said Moriarty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sergeant looked into the car. He gazed at the steering-wheel with
      interest. He glanced intelligently at the levers. His eyes rested finally
      on a speedometer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The like of that,&rdquo; he said, pointing it out to Moriarty, &ldquo;is what I never
      seen before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of them,&rdquo; said Moriarty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a clock along with it,&rdquo; said the sergeant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man that owns it,&rdquo; said Moriarty, &ldquo;must have a power of money.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p>
      Doyle came out of the hotel. He joined the sergeant and Moriarty at the
      motor-car.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning, sergeant,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fine day, thanks be to God. The
      people will only have themselves to thank if they don&rsquo;t get their hay
      saved this weather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I&rsquo;m after saying to Constable Moriarty,&rdquo; said the sergeant, &ldquo;is that
      that&rsquo;s a fine car.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may say that,&rdquo; said Doyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be some high up gentleman that owns it,&rdquo; said the sergeant.
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused. It was plainly the duty of Doyle to give some information about
      his guest. But Doyle remained silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll have a power of money, whoever he is,&rdquo; said Moriarty.
    </p>
    <p>
      He and the sergeant looked at Doyle and waited. Doyle still remained
      silent. The door of the office of the <i>Connacht Eagle</i> opened and
      Thaddeus Gallagher shambled along the street. He was a tall, grizzled man,
      exceedingly lean and ill-shaven. His clothes, which were shabby, hung
      round him in desponding folds. His appearance would have led a stranger to
      suppose that the <i>Connacht Eagle</i> was not a paying property. He
      greeted Sergeant Colgan and Moriarty with friendly warmth. When he had
      nothing else to write leading articles about he usually denounced the
      police, accusing them of various crimes, from the simple swearing away of
      the liberties of innocent men to the debauching of the morals of the young
      women of Ballymoy. But this civic zeal did not prevent his being on
      perfectly friendly terms with the members of the force. Nor did his strong
      writing rouse any feeling of resentment in the mind of the sergeant. He
      and Moriarty welcomed the editor warmly and invited him to inspect the
      car.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thaddeus Gallagher looked at the car critically. He rubbed his hand along
      the dusty mud guard, opened and shut one of the doors, stroked the bulb of
      the horn cautiously, and then turned to Doyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it the Lord-Lieutenant you have within in the hotel?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke with a fine suggestion of scorn in his voice. As a prominent
      local politician Thaddeus Gallagher was obliged to be contemptuous of
      Lords-Lieutenant. Doyle looked offended and at first made no reply.
      Sergeant Colgan, acting as peacemaker, spoke in a noncommittal, but
      soothing tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might be,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it very well might be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not then,&rdquo; said Doyle. &ldquo;Nor it&rsquo;s not the Chief Secretary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s not,&rdquo; said Gallagher, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s some other of them fellows out of
      Dublin Castle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a high up gentleman surely,&rdquo; said Sergeant Colgan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And one that has money to spare,&rdquo; added Constable Moriarty. &ldquo;It could be
      that he&rsquo;s one of the bosses of the Congested Districts Board. Them ones is
      well paid and has motors kept for them along with their salaries, so they
      tell me anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Mary Ellen came out of the hotel. She stood at a little distance and
      smiled pleasantly at Constable Moriarty. Doyle turned on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it that you want now, Mary Ellen?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t you
      within attending on the gentleman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure I am,&rdquo; said Mary Ellen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not,&rdquo; said Doyle. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I see you standing there grinning at
      Constable Moriarty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s after asking for his dinner,&rdquo; said Mary Ellen.
    </p>
    <p>
      She referred of course to Mr. Billing. The suggestion that she was
      grinning at Moriarty was unworthy of her notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if he is,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you give it to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;ll I give him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give him chops,&rdquo; said Doyle. &ldquo;And if there&rsquo;s no chops in the house&mdash;and
      there may not be&mdash;run across to Kerrigan the butcher and ask him for
      a couple. It&rsquo;ll be quicker than killing a chicken; but that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ll
      have to do in the latter end if Kerrigan has no chops.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was only this morning,&rdquo; said Sergeant Colgan hopefully, &ldquo;that Kerrigan
      killed a sheep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary Ellen crossed the street towards Kerrigan&rsquo;s shop. Constable Moriarty
      winked at her as she passed. Mary Ellen was a good girl. She took no
      notice of the wink. The sergeant, unfortunately, did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along out of this, Constable Moriarty,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Have you no duties
      to perform that you can afford to be standing there all day making faces
      at Mary Ellen? Come along now if you don&rsquo;t want me to report you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sergeant Colgan, though Gallagher insinuated evil things about him, was a
      man with a strict sense of propriety. He must have wanted very much to
      hear something more about Doyle&rsquo;s guest, but he marched off up the street
      followed by Moriarty. Doyle and Gallagher watched them until they were out
      of sight. Then Gallagher spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he isn&rsquo;t the Lord-Lieutenant,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and if he isn&rsquo;t the Chief
      Secretary, will you tell me who he is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my opinion,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;that he&rsquo;s a Yank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;ve much of an opinion of Yanks,&rdquo; said Gallagher.
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s in my mind that the country would be better if there was fewer of
      them came back to us. What I say is this: What good are they? What do they
      do, only upset the minds of the people, teaching them to be disrespectful
      to the clergy and to use language the like of which decent people ought
      not to use?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my opinion that he is a Yank anyway,&rdquo; said Doyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary Ellen returned from Kerrigan&rsquo;s shop. She carried a small parcel,
      wrapped in newspaper. It contained two chops for Mr. Billing&rsquo;s dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary Ellen,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;is it your opinion that the gentleman within is
      a Yank?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He might be,&rdquo; said Mary Ellen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go you on in then,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;and be cooking them chops for him. Why
      would you keep him waiting for his dinner and him maybe faint with the
      hunger?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why would you say he was a Yank?&rdquo; said Gallagher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why would I say it? You&rsquo;d say it yourself, Thady Gallagher if so be you&rsquo;d
      heard the way he was talking. &lsquo;Is there a live man in the place at all?&rsquo; 
      says he, meaning Ballymoy. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s waking up you want.&rsquo; says he.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he? The devil take him,&rdquo; said Gallagher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And I&rsquo;ve a good mind to try and wake you up myself,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m
      reckoned middling good at waking people up where I come from,&rsquo; says he.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him try,&rdquo; said Gallagher. &ldquo;Let him try if it pleases him. We&rsquo;ll teach
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gallagher spoke with an impressive display of truculent self-confidence.
      He had at the moment no doubt whatever that he could subdue Mr. Billing or
      any other insolent American. His opportunity came almost at once. Mr.
      Billing appeared at the door of the hotel. He looked extraordinarily cool
      and competent. He also looked rather severe. His forehead was puckered to
      a frown. It seemed that he was slightly annoyed about something. Gallagher
      feared that his last remark might have been overheard. He shrank back a
      little, putting Doyle between him and Mr. Billing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say,&rdquo; said Mr. Billing, &ldquo;is there any way of getting a move on that hired
      girl of yours? It&rsquo;ll be time for breakfast to-morrow morning before she
      brings my lunch if some one doesn&rsquo;t hustle her a bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary Ellen,&rdquo; shouted Doyle. &ldquo;Mary Ellen, will you hurry up now and cook
      the gentleman&rsquo;s dinner?&rdquo; Then he sank his voice. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s frying the chops
      this minute,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If you was to stand at the kitchen door you&rsquo;d hear
      them in the pan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thaddeus Gallagher, reassured and confident that Mr. Billing had not
      overheard his threat, stepped forward and stood bowing, his hat in his
      hands. Wealthy Americans may be objectionable, but they are rare in the
      west of Ireland. Gallagher felt that he would like to know Mr. Billing.
      Doyle introduced him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Mr. Gallagher,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Mr. Thaddeus Gallagher, J. P.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Billing bowed courteously and shook hands with Mr. Gallagher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Proud to meet you, sir,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Proud to meet any prominent citizen of
      this section.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Thady Gallagher,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;is the proprietor of the <i>Connacht
      Eagle</i>, our principal newspaper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Connacht Eagle was, in fact, the only newspaper in Ballymoy. It was
      the only newspaper published within a radius of forty miles from Ballymoy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It could therefore be quite truthfully called the principal one. Mr.
      Billing shook Thady Gallagher&rsquo;s hand again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a newspaper man myself,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I control two-thirds of the press
      in the state where I belong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thady Gallagher seemed greatly impressed by this statement. Doyle felt
      more than ever that his new guest was a man who ought to be treated with
      all possible consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It could be,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that them chops would be ready for you now, and
      if you&rsquo;ll tell the girl what it is you&rsquo;d like to drink&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I&rsquo;ve finished my lunch,&rdquo; said Mr. Billing, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to take a
      stroll round this section. There are some things I want to see. Perhaps
      Mr. Gallagher will come with me, if he can spare the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thady Gallagher will be pleased,&rdquo; said Doyle. &ldquo;And as for sparing the
      time, he has plenty of that. You&rsquo;ll go with the gentleman, won&rsquo;t you,
      Thady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, of course,&rdquo; said Gallagher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there&rsquo;s no man knows the neighbourhood better,&rdquo; said Doyle. &ldquo;There
      isn&rsquo;t one in it, man, woman, or child, that he isn&rsquo;t acquainted with, and
      anything there might be to tell about their fathers or mothers before
      them, Thady Gallagher is well fit to tell it to you.&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I&rsquo;d like to be shown first,&rdquo; said Mr. Billing, &ldquo;is the statue to the
      memory of General John Regan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doyle looked at Gallagher doubtfully. Gallagher edged away a little. He
      seemed inclined to take shelter again behind Doyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The statue?&rdquo; said Doyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Statue or other memorial,&rdquo; said Mr. Billing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With regard to the statue&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; said Doyle slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he turned round and caught Gallagher by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak up, Thady Gallagher,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and tell the gentleman about the
      statue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With reference to the statue&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; said Gallagher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Billing encouragingly, &ldquo;the statue to General John Regan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With reference to the statue of the deceased general,&rdquo; said Gallagher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What he&rsquo;s wanting to say,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;is that at the present time
      there&rsquo;s no statue to the General, not in Ballymoy, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You surprise me some,&rdquo; said Mr. Billing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s what there ought to be,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s a fact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Ballymoy such a nursery of heroes,&rdquo; said Mr. Billing, &ldquo;that you can
      afford to neglect the memory of the great General, the patriot statesman,
      the deliverer of Bolivia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak up, Thady,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;and tell the gentleman why there&rsquo;s no
      statue to the General in Ballymoy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gallagher cleared his throat and began to speak. At first his words came
      to him slowly; but as he warmed to his subject he became fluent and even
      eloquent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s on account of the way we find ourselves situated in this country at
      the present time,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the hearts of the people that&rsquo;s at
      fault. There isn&rsquo;t one, not the poorest man among us, that wouldn&rsquo;t be
      willing to do honour to the memory of the great men of the past that died
      on the scaffold in defence of the liberty of the people. It&rsquo;s the cursed
      system of Castle Government and the tyranny of the landlords, and the way
      the people is driven off their farms by the rack-renting flunkeys of the
      rent office. How is the country to prosper, and how is statues to be
      erected to them that deserve statues, so long as the people isn&rsquo;t able to
      call their souls their own? But, glory be to God, it won&rsquo;t be so for long!
      We have Home Rule as good as got, and when we have it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gallagher might have gone on speaking for a long time. He was a man of
      tried and practised eloquence. He had arrived without much effort at his
      favourite subject. Fragments of old speeches, glowing periods,
      oft-repeated perorations thronged confusedly on his memory. Mr. Billing
      seemed to be listening with sympathy and admiration. It might be a long
      time before such a favourable opportunity for making a speech came to
      Gallagher again. Unfortunately he was interrupted. Mary Ellen had come,
      unperceived, out of the hotel. She was at Mr. Billing&rsquo;s elbow just when
      Gallagher reached his prophecy about Home Rule. She spoke without the
      slightest regard for the orator&rsquo;s feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The chops is fried,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doyle had often heard his friend make speeches before. He had no wish to
      be subjected to unnecessary oratory on a very hot day. He supported Mary
      Ellen&rsquo;s appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be as well for you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to go and eat them, the way they
      won&rsquo;t be getting cold on you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Billing saw the wisdom of this advice at once. He turned to go into
      the hotel. But he evidently wanted to hear more of Thady Gallagher&rsquo;s
      speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I&rsquo;ve finished my lunch,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I shall look forward to a long
      talk with Mr. Gallagher. I want to gather together all the local
      traditions which survive about the boyhood of the great General. I&rsquo;m
      writing his biography, gentlemen. I need say no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary Ellen,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;whatever the gentleman fancies in the way of a
      drink, will you see that he gets it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary Ellen, smiling pleasantly, walked in front of Mr. Billing and
      conducted him to the small ill-lighted room which Doyle called the
      Commercial Room of his hotel. There, on a very dirty table cloth, were a
      knife and fork, a plate which held two chops with a quantity of grease
      round them, and a dish with five pallid potatoes in it. The meal was not
      appetising. On a very hot day it was almost repulsive. But Mr. Billing was
      either really hungry or he was a man of unusual determination. He sat down
      to his chops with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that whisky is the drink you&rsquo;re most likely to have
      in this hotel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s porter,&rdquo; said Mary Ellen, &ldquo;and there&rsquo;s minerals, and there&rsquo;s
      ginger cordial.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m here for a week,&rdquo; said Mr. Billing, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put you wise in the
      matter of making cocktails. A Saratoga cocktail is a drink&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it whisky I&rsquo;ll bring you now?&rdquo; said Mary Ellen.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a girl of sense and wisdom. She was no more inclined to listen to
      Mr. Billing&rsquo;s panegyric of the Saratoga cocktail than to Thady Gallagher&rsquo;s
      patriotic denunciation of the flunkeys of the rent office. Without waiting
      for an answer she went away and brought Mr. Billing the usual quantity of
      Irish whisky in the bottom of a tumbler with a bottle of soda water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doyle and Thady Gallagher, left alone in the street, stared at each other
      in silence. It was Doyle who spoke first:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you want, Thady,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is a drop of something to drink, to
      revive the courage in you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of a fellow is that at all?&rdquo; said Thady hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A pint of porter, now,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;or a drop of spirits. You want it
      this minute, and you&rsquo;ll want it more before, you&rsquo;re through with the job
      that you have on hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He led the way into the bar and provided Thady with a satisfying draught.
      Thady emptied the tumbler without drawing breath. Then he took his pipe
      from his pocket and lit it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Doyle,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a man I&rsquo;ve a liking for and always had.
      What&rsquo;s more, you&rsquo;re a man I respect, and it isn&rsquo;t everyone that I would
      say that to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same to you,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;and may you live long to enjoy it. Will
      you have another drop?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind if I do,&rdquo; said Thady.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doyle filled up the empty tumbler. As he did so Gallagher spoke with
      serious deliberation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seeing that you&rsquo;re a man I&rsquo;ve every confidence in, I&rsquo;d be glad if you&rsquo;d
      tell me this. Who was General John Regan? For I never heard tell of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be better for you, Thady, to know something about him be the same
      more or less, before the gentleman within has finished his dinner. He&rsquo;ll
      be asking questions of you the whole of the rest of the day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him ask.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll have to be answering him, for he&rsquo;ll not rest contented without
      you do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no Regans here,&rdquo; said Gallagher, &ldquo;and what&rsquo;s more there never
      was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no statue anyway,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;nor there won&rsquo;t be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that there&rsquo;d be any harm in a statue,&rdquo; said Gallagher. &ldquo;What
      has me bothered is who the General was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be no statue,&rdquo; said Doyle. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very well to be talking,
      but the rates is too high already without an extra penny in the pound for
      a statue that nobody wants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be in favour of a statue myself,&rdquo; said Gallagher, &ldquo;unless, of
      course, the gentleman was to pay for it himself, and he might.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course if he was to pay for it, it would be different. By the look of
      the motor-car he came in I&rsquo;d say he&rsquo;d plenty of money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The idea that Mr. Billing could pay for a statue was a pleasant one, and
      it was always possible that he might do so. He appeared to be very anxious
      that there should be a statue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s some men,&rdquo; said Doyle hopefully, &ldquo;that has no sense in the way
      they spend what money they&rsquo;ve got.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gallagher admitted with a sigh that there are such men. He himself had
      no money, or very little. If, as he hoped, he succeeded in becoming a
      Member of Parliament, he would have money, large quantities of it, a full
      £400 a year. He would have more sense than to spend any of it in erecting
      statues. Doyle, on the other hand, had money. He lent it freely, at a high
      rate of interest, to the other inhabitants of Ballymoy. This was his idea
      of the proper use of money. To spend it on works of public utility or
      sentimental value, struck him as very foolish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be glad, all the same,&rdquo; said Gallagher, &ldquo;if I knew who the General
      was that he&rsquo;s talking about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It could be,&rdquo; said Doyle hopefully, &ldquo;that he was one of them ones that
      fought against the Government at the time of Wolfe Tone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He might, of course. But the gentleman was saying something about
      Bolivia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s that at all?&rdquo; said Doyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thady Gallagher did not know. Editors of newspapers are supposed to know
      everything and have succeeded in impressing the public with the idea that
      they do, but there are probably a few things about which even the ablest
      editor has to refer to encyclopedias; and Gallagher was not by any means
      at the top of his profession. The <i>Connacht Eagle</i> was indeed a paper
      which exercised a very great influence on the minds of those who read it,
      more influence, perhaps, than even <i>The Times</i> has on its
      subscribers. For the readers of Gallagher&rsquo;s leading articles and columns
      of news were still in that primitive stage of culture in which every
      statement made in print is accepted as certainly true, whereas the
      subscribers to <i>The Times</i> have been educated into an unworthy kind
      of scepticism. Also the readers of the <i>Connacht Eagle</i> read little
      or nothing else, while those who read <i>The Times</i> usually glance at
      one or two other papers as well, and even waste their time and unsettle
      their minds by dipping into books. Thus, in spite of the fact that <i>The
      Times</i> appears every day, and the <i>Connacht Eagle</i> only once a
      week, it is likely that the Irish paper exercises more real influence than
      the English one&mdash;produces, that is to say, more definite effect upon
      the opinions of men who have votes. The editor of <i>The Times</i> would
      perhaps scarcely recognise Thady Gallagher as a fellow journalist. He may
      know&mdash;would probably in any case be ashamed to admit that he did not
      know&mdash;where Bolivia is. Thady Gallagher did not know, and was
      prepared to confess his ignorance in private to his friend. Yet Gallagher
      was in reality the more important man of the two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know as much about Bolivia,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;as I do about the General, and
      that&rsquo;s nothing at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad it&rsquo;s you and not me,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;that he took the fancy to go
      out walking with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose now,&rdquo; said Gallagher, &ldquo;that you wouldn&rsquo;t come along with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;so you may make your mind easy about that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what harm it would do you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve things to look after,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;and anyway I don&rsquo;t fancy
      spending my time talking about a dead General that nobody ever heard of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s what I feel myself,&rdquo; said Gallagher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may feel it,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;but you&rsquo;ll have to go with him. It was you
      he asked and not me.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p>
      Dr. Lucius O&rsquo;Grady is the only medical man in Ballymoy. Whatever money
      there is to be won by the practice of the art of healing in the
      neighbourhood, Dr. O&rsquo;Grady wins and has all to himself. Unfortunately it
      is not nearly sufficient for his needs. He is not married and so cannot
      plead a wife and family as excuses for getting into debt. But he is a man
      of imaginative mind with an optimistic outlook upon life. Men of this kind
      hardly ever live within their incomes, however large their incomes are;
      and Dr. O&rsquo;Grady&rsquo;s was really small. The dullard does not want things which
      the man of lively imagination feels that he must have. The sour man of
      gloomy disposition is forever haunted by the possibility of misfortune. He
      hoards whatever pittance he may earn. Dr. O&rsquo;Grady had good spirits and a
      delightful confidence in life. He spent all, and more than all he had,
      feeling sure that the near future held some great good fortune for him&mdash;a
      deadly epidemic perhaps, which would send all the people of Ballymoy
      flocking to his surgery, or a post under the new Insurance Act The very
      qualities of mind which made him improvident made him also immensely
      popular. Everybody liked him. Even his creditors found it hard to speak
      harshly to him. He owed money to Doyle; but Doyle, though as keen as any
      man living on getting what was due to him, refrained from hurrying Dr.
      O&rsquo;Grady over much. He grumbled a great deal, but he allowed the account in
      the shop attached to the hotel to run on. He even advanced sums of hard
      cash when some distant creditor, a Dublin tailor, for instance, who did
      not appreciate the doctor&rsquo;s personal charm, became importunate. Between
      what was due in the shop for tea, sugar, whisky, tobacco, and other
      necessaries, and the money actually lent, Dr. O&rsquo;Grady owed Doyle rather
      more than £60. He owed Gallagher more than £1, being five years&rsquo; 
      subscription to the <i>Connacht Eagle</i>. He owed a substantial sum to
      Kerrigan, the butcher. He owed something to every other shopkeeper in
      Ballymoy. The only people to whom he did not owe money were Major Kent,
      Mr. Gregg, the District Inspector of Police, and Mr. Ford, the stipendiary
      magistrate. No one could have owed money to Mr. Ford because he was a hard
      and suspicious man who never lent anything. Nobody could have borrowed
      from Mr. Gregg, because Mr. Gregg, who had just got married, had no money
      to lend. Major Kent had a little money and would have lent it to Dr.
      O&rsquo;Grady, would, in fact, have given it to him without any hope of ever
      getting it back again, but the doctor refused to borrow from him. He had a
      conscientious objection to victimising his personal friends. Doyle, so he
      explained, lived very largely by lending money, and therefore offered
      himself as fair game to the impecunious borrower. The shopkeepers throve
      on a system of credit. They were fair game too. Major Kent was in a
      different case. To borrow from him was to take a mean advantage of the
      good nature of a simple, unprofessional man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Kent and Dr. O&rsquo;Grady walked into Ballymoy together at about half
      past two on the day of Mr. Billing&rsquo;s arrival. They had lunched at
      Portsmouth Lodge, the Major&rsquo;s house. Dr. O&rsquo;Grady had given his opinion of
      a new filly which the Major had bought a few days before. It was a very
      unfavourable opinion, and the Major, who had the greatest confidence in
      the doctor&rsquo;s judgment, was duly depressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I were you, Major,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d sell that one at once. She&rsquo;s
      no good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d sell her fast enough,&rdquo; said the Major gloomily, &ldquo;if I could find a
      buyer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was £30 you gave for her in the fair?&rdquo; said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was; and if you&rsquo;re right about her she&rsquo;s not worth the half of it.
      She&rsquo;s not worth £12.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I happen to know that fellow Geraghty,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;The man who
      stuck you with her. He&rsquo;s a patient of mine. I pulled him through his last
      attack of d. t.&lsquo;s so I know all there is to know about him. He&rsquo;d stick an
      archangel. If he happened to be selling him a pair of wings it would turn
      out afterwards that the feathers were dropping out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you know him,&rdquo; said the Major, &ldquo;you know a blackguard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After sticking you with the filly,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;he spent the
      evening drinking in the hotel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the more he drank the bigger the price was that he said he got from
      you. When Doyle turned him out in the end he was saying that he had your
      cheque for £60 in his pocket. I don&rsquo;t suppose Doyle believed that. Nobody
      would. But he probably thinks you gave £40 or £45.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All I gave was £30. But I don&rsquo;t see that it matters what Doyle believes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does matter,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;If Doyle believes you gave £40 for
      the filly, and if you were to offer her to him for £35 he&rsquo;d think he was
      getting a bargain and he&rsquo;d jump at it. Doyle&rsquo;s just the kind of fool who
      thinks he knows all about horses and so he&rsquo;s quite an easy man to stick.
      Come on now, and we&rsquo;ll try.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Major Kent was in all ordinary affairs of life a strictly honourable man.
      But horses are not ordinary affairs. It is on record that a bishop, an
      Irishman and therefore intensely religious, once sold a thoroughly unsound
      horse to an archdeacon for a large price. The archdeacon had a high
      opinion of the bishop beforehand, regarding him as a saintly man of
      childlike simplicity. He had a much higher opinion of him after he
      understood the failings of the animal he had bought. He then respected the
      bishop for his shrewdness. Horse-dealing is a thing apart from all other
      buying and selling. Honesty, in the common sense of the word, does not
      enter into it. Therefore, Major Kent was quite ready to defraud Doyle if
      he could. He and Dr. O&rsquo;Grady walked into Ballymoy together for the
      purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      They reached the corner of the market square and caught sight of Mr.
      Billing&rsquo;s large motor-car standing outside the hotel. Doyle and Gallagher,
      who had stopped drinking, were standing near it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Doyle&rsquo;s bought that motor,&rdquo; said the Major, &ldquo;he won&rsquo;t look at the
      filly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;What would he do with the motor if he had
      it? All the same it&rsquo;s queer. I don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s doing there. Nobody
      with money enough to own a car like that could possibly be stopping at
      Doyle&rsquo;s Hotel. Come along and let&rsquo;s find out about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They hurried across the square and greeted Doyle and Gallagher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whose is the big motor?&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It belongs to an American gentleman,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;who&rsquo;s within in the
      hotel. We&rsquo;re waiting for him this minute. He&rsquo;s getting his camera, and
      when he has it got he&rsquo;s going round with Thady Gallagher to photograph the
      town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gallagher took Major Kent by the arm and drew him apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Major,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;can you tell me who was General John Regan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never heard of him,&rdquo; said the Major, &ldquo;but if he owns that car he must be
      a middling well-off man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Doyle,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;you know that filly the Major
      bought at the fair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of her,&rdquo; said Doyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, as it happens,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;she turns out to be a bit too
      good for what he wants. His idea was to get something to do a bit of
      carting, and it turns out that this one is&mdash;well, she has breeding.
      Now, look here, Doyle&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He led Doyle apart just out of earshot of the Major and Gallagher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I owe you a trifle, don&rsquo;t I, Doyle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As near as I can go to it without looking at my books,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;you
      owe me £60, and I&rsquo;d be thankful if so be that it&rsquo;s quite convenient to you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a bit convenient,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;but I quite admit that I
      owe the money. Now what I suggest is this. I&rsquo;ve persuaded the Major to let
      you have that filly cheap, dirt cheap. It will be found money to you,
      Doyle, if you get her at the price the Major&rsquo;s going to name, and you may
      be able to knock a pound or two off that. Under these circumstances and
      seeing that I&rsquo;m putting the chance in your way&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t everyone
      that could, but I&rsquo;m a friend of the Major&rsquo;s and he trusts me&mdash;I think
      you ought to stop talking about the trifle I owe you. I&rsquo;m sick of the
      subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not near as sick of it as I am,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t know
      that I want the filly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do want her,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;You want anything that you can make
      money out of. Hullo! Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Billing, carrying his camera, appeared at the door of the hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the American gentleman that owns the motorcar,&rdquo; said Doyle. &ldquo;Tell me
      this now, doctor. Did ever you hear of General John Regan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I did,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a well-known millionaire, just
      the sort of man to be touring the country in a big motor. Go you off now
      and settle with the Major about the filly. I&rsquo;ll entertain the General for
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, doctor, be careful what you say,&rdquo; said Doyle in a
      whisper. &ldquo;The General&rsquo;s dead this twenty years and it&rsquo;s a statue there
      ought to be to his memory. So that fellow&rsquo;s after saying, any way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, all right,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just the same thing. I&rsquo;ll manage.
      You go and settle with the Major.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He approached Mr. Billing jauntily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Delighted to meet you, sir,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Delighted to welcome you to
      Ballymoy. You&rsquo;ll find it a most interesting locality. My name is O&rsquo;Grady,
      Lucius O&rsquo;Grady, M.D.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Billing took off his hat, laid down his camera, and shook hands with
      the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mine is Billing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Horace P. Billing. I come from America. My
      object in visiting Ballymoy&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The poor old General, of course,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;We thought you&rsquo;d be
      sure to come sooner or later. Your uncle, wasn&rsquo;t he, or great uncle? I
      forget.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Billing seemed surprised, very much surprised. He dropped Dr.
      O&rsquo;Grady&rsquo;s hand abruptly and stared at him. Then he recovered himself with
      an effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t claim relationship with that great man,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a pity,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m his biographer,&rdquo; said Mr. Billing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m engaged in writing the first
      complete life of the founder of the Bolivian Republic. I have come to
      Ballymoy&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t possibly have come to a better place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. O&rsquo;Grady was not a literary man, but he had an idea that people who
      write books seek out quiet places in which they are not likely to be over
      excited while engaged in their trying work. Ballymoy seemed to him a
      suitable place for anyone engaged in writing a biography.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It surprises me some,&rdquo; said Mr. Billing, &ldquo;to find that you&rsquo;ve no statue
      erected to the memory of the General. I&rsquo;d have thought&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The matter is under discussion,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;Our Urban District
      Council is alive to its duty in the matter. At the last meeting&mdash;let
      me see now, was it the last meeting? Gallagher! Thady Gallagher! Come here
      for a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thady Gallagher, who had been acting as umpire in an animated wrangle
      between Doyle and Major Kent, shambled across to the door of the hotel
      where Dr. O&rsquo;Grady and Mr. Billing were standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it the last meeting of the Urban District Council,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady,
      &ldquo;or was it the last but one, that you were discussing the erection of a
      statue to General John Regan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not venture to wink as he asked the question, but Gallagher was
      quite quick-witted enough to give the proper answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the last meeting,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a slight difference of opinion among the members,&rdquo; said Dr.
      O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;as to the form which the memorial was to take. Some of them
      wanted a life-size statue in white marble. Mr. Gallagher here was more in
      favour of a drinking fountain. It was you who wanted the fountain wasn&rsquo;t
      it, Thady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was,&rdquo; said Gallagher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a cheaper form of memorial,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;so as to spare the
      rates as far as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said Gallagher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will allow me to say so,&rdquo; said Mr. Billing, &ldquo;the question of
      expense ought not to be allowed to stand in your way. I myself will gladly
      promise&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Billing hesitated for a moment. It was not clear whether he meant to
      promise a handsome subscription or merely to say that he would help in
      collecting the necessary money. Dr. O&rsquo;Grady thought it well to assume at
      once that a subscription had been promised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;take note of that, Thady, and announce it to the Urban
      District Council at the next meeting. Mr. Billing will hand over his
      subscription to the treasurer as soon as one is appointed. You can arrange
      about a proper vote of thanks being passed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Billing seemed quite pleased at this interpretation of his unfinished
      sentence. He went on to make another promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I think I may safely guarantee,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;on behalf of the people of
      Bolivia&mdash;&mdash;they can never forget&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They oughtn&rsquo;t to,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;After all he did more for them than
      he ever did for us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was born here,&rdquo; said Mr. Billing, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s something to be proud
      of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we are proud of it. Thady Gallagher is having an article in his paper
      next week saying how much we appreciate the dear old General. Aren&rsquo;t you,
      Thady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am, of course,&rdquo; said Gallagher.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, lest he should be committed any further, Gallagher slipped away and
      joined Major Kent and Doyle. They were standing together near the motorcar
      in high debate as to whether the price of the filly was to be £30 or £34.
      The Major had abated one pound of the price he asked at first. Doyle had,
      so far, resisted every effort to induce him to make an advance upon his
      original offer. They were both enjoying themselves greatly. But Gallagher
      interrupted them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The doctor knows all about him,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;thanks be to God he&rsquo;s&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a filly,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;and I know as much about her as the doctor
      does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had for the moment forgotten his American guest, and was thinking only
      of the animal which Major Kent was trying to sell him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the General I&rsquo;m talking about,&rdquo; said Gallagher in an aggrieved tone,
      &ldquo;and the doctor says there&rsquo;s to be an article on the paper about him next
      week. But if there is the doctor may write it himself. It&rsquo;ll be easy for
      him seeing he knows who the General was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He does not know any more than the rest of us,&rdquo; said Doyle. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t he
      say a minute ago he was a well-known millionaire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He knows now, anyway,&rdquo; said Gallagher, &ldquo;and what&rsquo;s more he says that the
      Urban District Council has been talking about erecting a statue to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Erecting a statue to who?&rdquo; said the Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To General John Regan, of course,&rdquo; said Gallagher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But sure there was no such talk,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;not that I heard of,
      anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was not,&rdquo; said Gallagher, &ldquo;but there will be now; and there might
      have been. There&rsquo;s no denying that there might have been.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doyle,&rdquo; said the Major anxiously. &ldquo;We must finish settling the price of
      the filly later on. I&rsquo;m nervous, I&rsquo;m confoundedly nervous about what the
      doctor may be doing. You never know what wild idea he may take into his
      head, or what he may let us all in for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Gallagher. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I tell you he&rsquo;s arranging with
      the American gentleman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may be getting us all into some mess or other. You never know what the
      doctor will be at. He&rsquo;s so infernally imaginative.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Billing and Dr. O&rsquo;Grady had left the door of the hotel. They were
      standing together in the middle of the square almost opposite the police
      barrack. Major Kent hurried towards them. Doyle and Gallagher followed him
      slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this talk about a statue?&rdquo; said Doyle. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you before
      that I&rsquo;d agree to no statue? Isn&rsquo;t the rates high enough already without
      that? And don&rsquo;t I have to pay more of them than any other man in the
      town?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be no addition to the rates,&rdquo; said Gallagher. &ldquo;The way the
      doctor was fixing it up it&rsquo;ll be the American gentleman that&rsquo;ll pay for
      the statue. He&rsquo;s just after saying he will, and the Urban District Council
      is to pass a vote of thanks to him, which is what they&rsquo;ll be glad to do,
      and I&rsquo;ll draw it up myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Doyle, slightly mollified, &ldquo;if he pays the cost of it
      there&rsquo;ll be no objection to the statue. But are you sure now that he&rsquo;s
      fit? Statues cost a deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at the motor-car he came in,&rdquo; said Gallagher.
    </p>
    <p>
      The motor seemed conclusive evidence. It was a very splendid vehicle.
      Doyle hurried forward. A stranger who proposed to spend large sums of
      money in the town deserved to be treated with every kind of politeness and
      respect. A statue still struck Doyle as an exceedingly useless thing; but
      he was not without hope that Mr. Billing might be persuaded to give his
      money, if he really wanted to give money, to some more sensible object.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. O&rsquo;Grady introduced Major Kent to Mr. Billing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our principal resident gentleman,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a J. P. and a strong
      Unionist. Gallagher, of course, is a Home Ruler. But these little
      political differences of opinion don&rsquo;t really matter. They&rsquo;re both equally
      keen on doing their duty to the memory of the great General.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; said the Major. &ldquo;What General are you talking about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;General John Regan,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? What?&rdquo; said the Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give yourself away now, Major,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, in a whisper.
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let Mr. Billing find out that you&rsquo;ve never heard of the General.
      You ought to have heard of him. The Major,&rdquo; he said aloud, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t as well
      up in the General&rsquo;s history as he might be. He hasn&rsquo;t studied the details
      of his campaigns; but he quite agrees with the rest of us that there ought
      to be a statue to his memory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. O&rsquo;Grady has just informed me,&rdquo; said Mr. Billing, &ldquo;that the centre of
      this square is the site that has been selected by your Urban District
      Council.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The very spot we&rsquo;re standing on at the present moment,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady.
      &ldquo;The Major has promised £5, which shows how keen he is on the project.
      Don&rsquo;t say you haven&rsquo;t, Major. We all know that you&rsquo;re a modest man, doing
      good by stealth and blushing to find it known. But a public subscription
      can&rsquo;t be kept secret. Sooner or later the list of subscribers will have to
      be published. Doyle,&rdquo; he looked round as he spoke and saw Doyle and
      Gallagher standing near him. &ldquo;Doyle has promised another £5. He ought to
      be giving more, and I daresay he will in the end. He&rsquo;s a much richer man
      than the Major, though he doesn&rsquo;t look it. Gallagher is good for another
      pound. It doesn&rsquo;t sound much from a newspaper editor, but it&rsquo;s as much as
      he can afford. Half the advertisements in his paper aren&rsquo;t paid for at
      all. Father McCormack&mdash;he&rsquo;s the parish priest, and we haven&rsquo;t asked
      him yet, but he&rsquo;ll put down his name for £10 at least. He always supports
      every kind of good work liberally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said Mr. Billing, &ldquo;you may put me down for five hundred
      dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doyle and Gallagher drew pieces of paper and pencils from their pockets.
      They did sums rapidly, Doyle on the back of an old envelope, Gallagher on
      a sheet of paper already covered with shorthand notes. Dr. O&rsquo;Grady worked
      his sum in his head. He arrived at his answer first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hundred pounds!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A generous subscription!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s more than a hundred,&rdquo; said Doyle. &ldquo;What do you make it, Thady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Counting 4s. 2d. to the dollar,&rdquo; said Gallagher, &ldquo;it comes to&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a halfpenny along with that,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;as often as not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; said Gallagher, &ldquo;it won&rsquo;t be less than £104 3s. 4d.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Urban District Council,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;will take a delight in passing
      that vote of thanks to Mr. Billing at its next meeting, and it&rsquo;ll be a
      good strong vote, won&rsquo;t it, Thady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As strong as ever any one that was passed about the landlords,&rdquo; said
      Gallagher, &ldquo;only different, of course, mighty different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, O&rsquo;Grady,&rdquo; said Major Kent. &ldquo;What do you mean by saying that
      I&rsquo;m going to subscribe £5? Who is this General you&rsquo;re all talking about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do shut up, Major,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s all right if you&rsquo;ll
      only keep quiet. As you&rsquo;ve got a camera with you, Mr. Billing,&rdquo; he went
      on, &ldquo;you might like to take a photograph of that house opposite you. It
      was there that the great General&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glory be to God,&rdquo; said Gallagher, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the police barrack!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The birthplace of the great General?&rdquo; said Mr. Billing, taking off his
      hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;Thady Gallagher will show you his
      birthplace this afternoon. This is the house in which he spent his early
      youth, up to the age of eleven years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; said Mr. Billing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just get my camera. A view of that
      house will be most interesting. I certainly ought to have it for my
      biography.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He crossed the road to the hotel and picked up his camera. He carried it
      to the middle of the square and set up the tripod legs. Then he screwed
      the camera into its place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O&rsquo;Grady,&rdquo; said Major Kent, angrily. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to make a public
      exposure of you before a total stranger, but if you don&rsquo;t stop trying to
      make fools of us all&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about, Major,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
      making a fool of anyone. I&rsquo;m helping to persuade Mr. Billing to erect a
      statue in this town. You can&rsquo;t deny that a statue would be an improvement
      to the place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A statue!&rdquo; said the Major. &ldquo;Who to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Heavens!&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;haven&rsquo;t you grasped that yet? To
      General John Regan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Billing had his head under a black cloth. He was screwing the lens of
      his camera backwards and forwards and appeared to be entirely absorbed in
      his photography.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me now, doctor,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;before we go further into the matter&mdash;&mdash;
      Mind you, I&rsquo;m not saying a word against what you&rsquo;re doing, but I&rsquo;d be glad
      to know who was General John Regan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m to show the American gentleman the birthplace of the General,&rdquo;
       said Gallagher, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll need to know where it is. Will you tell me this now,
      doctor, where was the General born?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t time,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;to give you all elementary lectures
      on modern history; and I certainly haven&rsquo;t the temper to spend all day
      hammering into your heads simple facts which&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Facts!&rdquo; said the Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go home, Major,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve no tact, and in an affair of
      this kind where the highest kind of diplomacy is necessary, you&rsquo;re not
      only useless, you&rsquo;re actually dangerous. Now, Doyle, do you or do you not
      want to have the handling of that American gentleman&rsquo;s £100? You do, of
      course. Very well then. Leave the matter in my hands and don&rsquo;t annoy me by
      asking frivolous questions. Thady, the birthplace of the General is one of
      those ruined cottages&mdash;it doesn&rsquo;t in the least matter which&mdash;on
      the grass farm where Doyle has his cattle ever since you and your League
      prevented anyone else taking the place. You ought to have known that
      without bothering me. Good Heavens! Here&rsquo;s the police sergeant coming to
      ask questions now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sergeant Colgan and Constable Moriarty were approaching at a rapid walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Begging your pardon, doctor,&rdquo; said the sergeant, &ldquo;but is that a camera
      that the gentleman has, and is he thinking of taking a picture of the
      barrack?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;but he&rsquo;s not photographing it as a barrack at
      all. He&rsquo;s doing it in an entirely different spirit. So there&rsquo;s no
      necessity for you to start any theory about his being a German spy, or to
      raise stupid objections.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t thinking of objecting,&rdquo; said the sergeant. &ldquo;It makes no matter
      to me what notion he has in his head. But what Constable Moriarty was
      saying to me this minute&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he hesitated, and then added,
      &ldquo;speak up now, Moriarty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the sergeant said to me,&rdquo; said Moriarty, &ldquo;as soon as ever he seen
      the gentleman with the camera&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t me passed the remark,&rdquo; said the sergeant, &ldquo;but yourself. I&rsquo;ll
      not have it put out that I was the one&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Billing, standing bare-headed beside his camera, squeezed a yellow
      bulb and clicked the shutter of his lens. He turned smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A successful photograph, I hope, gentlemen,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The people of
      Bolivia will be interested to see it. It will adorn the first volume of
      the General&rsquo;s life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady to Sergeant Colgan. &ldquo;That comes of not speaking
      out promptly. The photograph is taken now and whatever remark it was that
      you or Moriarty made will be entirely wasted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity, so it is,&rdquo; said the sergeant, &ldquo;for what Constable Moriarty
      was after saying&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the sergeant said,&rdquo; said Moriarty, &ldquo;is that he&rsquo;d be glad if the
      gentleman would take him along with the barrack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not often,&rdquo; said the sergeant, &ldquo;that we have anyone taking
      photographs round in these parts, and Constable Moriarty would have been
      pleased to be took on account of being able to send the photo after to a
      young lady that he is acquainted with up in Dublin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no young lady up in Dublin,&rdquo; said Moriarty sulkily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. O&rsquo;Grady was a man of quick sympathy and a kind heart. He realised at
      once that both Sergeant Colgan and Constable Moriarty wanted to have their
      photographs taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go over to the door of the barrack,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and arrange yourselves in
      such a way as to look as ornamental as possible. I&rsquo;ll try to get the
      gentleman to take another photograph.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Billing had slipped his dark slide into his pocket, and was unscrewing
      his camera from its stand. Dr. O&rsquo;Grady called to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you got your photograph wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mistake about the house,&rdquo; said Mr. Billing. &ldquo;Well, it can&rsquo;t be helped.
      Which is the right one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly that,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got the proper house, but
      the Major has just reminded me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not,&rdquo; said Major Kent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if it wasn&rsquo;t you it was Thady. Thady Gallagher has just reminded me
      that the top storey wasn&rsquo;t built when the General lived there. The
      Government added it afterwards when the place was bought for a police
      barrack. What you ought to do if you want to get the thing absolutely
      right is to take another photograph and make sure that the top storey
      doesn&rsquo;t come into it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m greatly obliged to you,&rdquo; said Mr. Billing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll expose a second
      plate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He arranged his camera again. Sergeant Colgan and Moriarty settled
      themselves in stiff attitudes, one on each side of the barrack door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I to take the two policemen as well?&rdquo; said Mr. Billing, looking out
      from beneath his black cloth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may as well,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;It will interest the Bolivians to
      see how this country is overrun with what Thady Gallagher calls the armed
      forces of an alien power.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I say is this,&rdquo; said Thady Gallagher, grasping at his opportunity,
      &ldquo;so long as the people of this country is kept in subjection and the
      cursed system of landlordism is supported&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, O&rsquo;Grady,&rdquo; said Major Kent, angrily, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t be expected to
      stand this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Major,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only poor old Thady. You
      know jolly well he doesn&rsquo;t mean a word of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As long as the sacredness of our homes is invaded,&rdquo; said Gallagher, &ldquo;and
      the virtues of our families corrupted by the overfed minions of the
      landlord class&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, do shut up, Thady,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;We all know that stuff off by
      heart, and you must try to recollect that the Major&rsquo;s a Unionist. He can&rsquo;t
      be expected to listen to you peaceably; and if we don&rsquo;t run this statue
      business on strictly non-political lines we&rsquo;ll never be able to carry it
      through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whisht now, Thady, whisht,&rdquo; said Doyle soothingly; &ldquo;sure the sergeant is
      doing you no harm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Billing clicked his shutter again. Sergeant Colgan and Constable
      Moriarty relapsed from their strained attitudes and breathed freely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got the lower storey all right?&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;Good. I daresay now
      you&rsquo;d like to toddle around with Thady Gallagher and see the General&rsquo;s
      birthplace. I&rsquo;m sorry I can&rsquo;t go with you myself, but I happen to be
      rather busy. There are two old women with rheumatism expecting bottles
      from me in the course of the afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fold up the camera,&rdquo; said Mr. Billing, &ldquo;and start at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; said Gallagher anxiously, &ldquo;what&rsquo;ll I do when he starts asking me
      questions about the General?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answer him, of course,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I, when I never heard tell of the General till to-day. For the
      love of God, doctor dear, will you tell me who he was?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thady,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ashamed of you. Aren&rsquo;t you a politician?
      You are, and well you know it. Aren&rsquo;t you a newspaper editor? You are,
      there&rsquo;s no use denying it. Don&rsquo;t you spend your whole life either talking
      or writing on subjects that you know nothing about? You do. And what on
      earth&rsquo;s the use of your pretending now that you can&rsquo;t answer a few simple
      questions about General John Regan? There now, he&rsquo;s got his camera folded
      up and he&rsquo;s waiting for you. Be off at once.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Motor-cars are even yet far from common in the west of Ireland. They are
      not, for instance, used in elections as they are in England. There very
      seldom are elections in the west of Ireland; but even if these
      entertainments were, as frequent as elsewhere motor-cars would not be used
      in them. This is partly because the Irish voter is recognised as
      incorruptible, not the kind of man who would allow his vote to be
      influenced by a ride in an unaccustomed vehicle; partly because the west
      of Ireland candidate for Parliament is not rich enough to keep a motor-car
      himself, and has no friends or supporters who could lend him anything more
      expensive than a horse. Therefore motor drives are an unknown luxury to
      most Connacht men. Thady Gallagher, though he was a newspaper editor, had
      never travelled even in the side car of a motor-cycle. When Mr. Billing
      made it clear that he meant to go to the General&rsquo;s birth-place in his
      large car everybody felt slightly envious of Gallagher, and Doyle wished
      that he had not refused to join the expedition. Gallagher himself was not
      elated by his good fortune. He was embarrassed and depressed. He cast an
      appealing glance at Doyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What am I to do, at all?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What am I to say to him when&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve any sense,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll take a good long drive now you
      have the chance. He doesn&rsquo;t know the way. What&rsquo;s to hinder you from taking
      him round every road within ten miles of the town?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the prospect did not cheer Gallagher. He tried to grasp Dr. O&rsquo;Grady&rsquo;s
      arm as he passed him. But the doctor shook him off impatiently. He even
      attempted an appeal to Major Kent, quite vainly. The Major was still
      smarting under the rhetorical denunciation of landlords. He would not at
      that moment have gone a step out of his way to rescue Gallagher from
      drowning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment the motor-car was out of sight Major Kent and Doyle turned
      hotly on Dr. O&rsquo;Grady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil do you mean, O&rsquo;Grady,&rdquo; said the Major, &ldquo;by talking in this
      absurd way? You know perfectly well&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doyle spoke at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a curious thing, so it is, doctor,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a curious thing
      that you&rsquo;d be letting me in for £5 when you know the loss I&rsquo;m in on
      account of you already. I&rsquo;d have thought&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. O&rsquo;Grady interrupted them both.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose you agree to split the difference,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and say £32 10s.
      for the filly. It&rsquo;s a pity to see two men like you losing your tempers
      over a bargain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the bargain,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;that has my temper riz. It&rsquo;s&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doyle can have the filly if he likes,&rdquo; said the Major, &ldquo;at £32 10s. I
      don&rsquo;t want to go on wrangling about that. What I want to know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take her,&rdquo; said Doyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Kent smiled faintly. He was getting out of what threatened to be a
      very bad bargain with an actual gain of £2 10s. He began to recover
      command of his temper. Doyle also smiled. He believed that he was buying
      for £32 10s. an animal for which Major Kent had paid £40 three days
      before. He felt kindly disposed towards Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, who had put the
      chance of such a bargain in his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Major,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;you trot along to my house while I speak a
      word or two to Doyle. I&rsquo;ll be round with you in about ten minutes, and
      give you some tea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But about that General?&rdquo; said the Major, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather like to know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He still wanted to know about General John Regan. But the tone in which he
      asked for information had changed. He no longer seemed to threaten.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll explain all that to you if you&rsquo;ll only do as I tell you,&rdquo; said Dr.
      O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;At present I can&rsquo;t because I&rsquo;m going to explain it to Doyle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t you explain it to both of us at once?&rdquo; said the Major. &ldquo;That is
      to say if there is any explanation of the way you&rsquo;ve been going on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are two explanations,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;one for you and one for
      Doyle. I can&rsquo;t give them both at once, because they&rsquo;re different. I should
      have thought you&rsquo;d have seen that for yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how there can be two explanations,&rdquo; said the Major, &ldquo;not two
      true ones. But of course they&rsquo;re neither of them that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re both quite true,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;but they&rsquo;re different, of
      course, because you and Doyle look at everything from such different
      points of view. Now do trot along, Major, and don&rsquo;t interrupt me any more.
      That American may be back at any moment. I don&rsquo;t believe Gallagher will be
      able to keep him in play for very long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took Major Kent by the shoulders as he spoke and pushed him some little
      way along the street. Then he returned to Doyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now then, Doyle,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve done pretty well over that filly.
      Strictly speaking, you owe me £7 10s. But I&rsquo;m not going to say a word
      about that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seeing that you owe me £60,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll maybe be as well for you
      not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I do want to talk about,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;is General John Regan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you tell me who he was,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be content.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that it matters in the least to you who he was. Look here
      now, Doyle. You&rsquo;re a business man, and among other things you sell whisky.
      Now suppose someone was to walk into your hotel and tell you to forward
      ten dozen bottles of whisky&mdash;the best you had&mdash;to his aunt, and
      supposing that he told his aunt&rsquo;s name was Regan, would you go questioning
      and cross-questioning every man you met as to whether there really was an
      old lady called Miss Regan at the address he gave you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would not,&rdquo; said Doyle. &ldquo;So long as I got my money I wouldn&rsquo;t care
      whether the fellow ever had an aunt, or what sort of a name there might be
      to her if he had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, this is exactly the same sort of case. Here&rsquo;s a man who wants a
      statue for a dead General, and is perfectly willing to pay for it. Why
      should you bother your head about who the statue is supposed to represent?
      £100 is £100, I suppose, even if there never was a Regan in the world; and
      there have been, plenty of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see that,&rdquo; said Doyle. &ldquo;I see that, now you put it to me. And I don&rsquo;t
      deny but there&rsquo;s a lot in what you say. But what I don&rsquo;t see is this: I&rsquo;d
      make something out of the whisky for the gentleman&rsquo;s aunt, but I don&rsquo;t
      understand how I&rsquo;m to make a penny out of the statue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be treasurer of the fund,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;and I needn&rsquo;t tell
      you that in all these cases the treasurer&mdash;well, there might be a
      little balance in hand at the end. There often is. Nobody ever inquires
      about those balances. If the treasurers are fools they lie in the banks
      and nobody ever gets any good of them. But you&rsquo;re not a fool, Doyle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not; and of course, there has been balances of the kind you speak of
      before now. I wouldn&rsquo;t say but&mdash;looking at the matter in that way&mdash;and
      besides there&rsquo;d be a commission from the fellow that got the contract for
      the statue. And with regard to the £5 that my name&rsquo;s down for&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come now, Doyle. Don&rsquo;t pretend to be stupider than you are. You know
      perfectly well that every public fund has to be started by somebody with a
      respectable looking subscription. I put it to you now as a business man,
      did you ever hear of a case in which a subscription of that kind was
      actually paid? It appears in the published list and it encourages other
      people, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say no more, doctor,&rdquo; said Doyle. &ldquo;Say no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall count on you then, Doyle, to help me in every way you possibly
      can. It&rsquo;s all for your own good. And you won&rsquo;t be doing anybody any harm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s just one thing more,&rdquo; said Doyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out with it. And be as quick as you can. I&rsquo;ve still got to soothe the
      Major&rsquo;s scruples.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind my asking the question,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;what are you
      going to make out of it yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a delicate point. I might tell you I&rsquo;m going into the business for
      the fun of the thing; but you wouldn&rsquo;t believe that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would not,&rdquo; said Doyle, winking slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was afraid you wouldn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s true, as it happens. That&rsquo;s just exactly
      why I am running this statue. It offers me a little excitement and
      variety. But as you won&rsquo;t believe it I&rsquo;ll have to make up some sort of a
      lie that you will believe. I owe you about £60, don&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do, doctor, but I&rsquo;d be the last man in Ireland to press you for the
      money if&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. If I put £20 into your pocket over this statue, in addition to
      the £7 10s. you&rsquo;re making on the filly, I&rsquo;ll expect you to stop talking
      about what I owe you for the next six months. You see some sense in that,
      don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it satisfies you as a reason for my taking all the trouble that I&rsquo;m
      going to take.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does, of course. Why wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. Believe it. But if the matter ever comes up again you&rsquo;ll
      remember, Doyle, that I offered you the truth and you wouldn&rsquo;t have it. I
      didn&rsquo;t attempt to impose on you with that lie until you insisted that I
      should.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doyle grinned. He did not for a moment believe that Dr. O&rsquo;Grady was going
      to give himself a great deal of trouble in the matter of General John
      Regan&rsquo;s statue without gaining something by it. But he admired the way in
      which the doctor, even when apparently cornered, succeeded in keeping up
      appearances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Gallagher gets tangled up in any difficulty,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, as he
      said good-bye to Doyle, &ldquo;send him straight round to me. Don&rsquo;t you attempt
      to extricate him or you&rsquo;ll make matters worse. I shall be at home for the
      next two hours. It will take me that time at least to talk sense into the
      Major.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he got back to his own house Dr. O&rsquo;Grady found his friend in a state
      of badly repressed impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That seems to have been a pretty long explanation which you gave to
      Doyle,&rdquo; said the Major. &ldquo;I hope mine will turn out to be a bit shorter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;will entirely depend on yourself, Major. If you
      were a really intelligent man no explanation whatever would be necessary.
      You&rsquo;d grasp the situation for yourself. If you were even fairly
      intelligent a short explanation would be quite sufficient. If, as I fear,
      you are downright stupid I may have to spend an hour or two talking to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see the slightest necessity for that,&rdquo; said the Major. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
      only got to give a simple answer to a perfectly plain question. Who was
      General John Regan? You answer that, and no further explanation will be
      necessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it will,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;Even if I tell you all I know
      about the General you&rsquo;ll still want to heckle me and generally upset my
      plans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t, O&rsquo;Grady. I promise you I won&rsquo;t. Just tell me all you know
      about this General and I won&rsquo;t say another word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything at all about the
      General. I never heard of him in my life until to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Major Kent gasped. Then he grew suddenly red in the face. Then he
      spluttered explosively. Then he burst into violent speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what the devil do you mean, O&rsquo;Grady, by &mdash;&mdash;? I&rsquo;m hanged if
      I ever heard of such&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you are,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;I knew you wouldn&rsquo;t be satisfied. I&rsquo;ve
      told you all I know about the General, and so far from saying nothing
      more, you begin to curse in the most frightful way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all very well,&rdquo; said the Major, &ldquo;but if there&rsquo;s no such person as
      that General&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say that. I said I knew nothing about him. I&rsquo;m a well educated
      man, Major, far better educated than you are. But there are thousands and
      thousands of quite eminent people still alive whose names I&rsquo;ve never
      heard, and when it comes to dead people there are probably millions,
      scattered up and down through history books, whom I know nothing about.
      They may all be quite famous in their own localities and may thoroughly
      deserve statues. It&rsquo;s not their fault that I know nothing about them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we don&rsquo;t any of us know anything about this General. I don&rsquo;t. Doyle
      doesn&rsquo;t. You don&rsquo;t. Why on earth should we put up a statue to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t we allow that American&mdash;Billing or whatever his name
      is&mdash;to put up a statue if he likes? He wants to. Why shouldn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should he put it up here?&rdquo; said the Major. &ldquo;What brings him to
      Ballymoy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady&mdash;&ldquo;mind, I don&rsquo;t know for certain&mdash;but
      I expect that he&rsquo;s come to the wrong place, mixed up Ballymoy with some
      other town, with the town in which Regan was really born. This General of
      his was evidently a pretty big pot in his way, and if he had been born in
      Ballymoy some of us would have heard of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; said the Major, &ldquo;we ought to tell Billing of his mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not. In the first place that would be a very unkind thing to
      do. Nobody likes being told of their mistakes, especially when they&rsquo;re as
      full of bounce and self-confidence as this fellow Billing. It&rsquo;s not right
      to be maliciously and wantonly unkind, Major, even to dumb animals; and I
      can&rsquo;t imagine anything more cruel than to tell Billing that he&rsquo;s made a
      mistake. In the next place, why on earth should we miss the chance of
      getting a statue in Ballymoy? We haven&rsquo;t got one at present, and a good
      statue&mdash;we&rsquo;ll get quite a respectable one for Billing&rsquo;s £100, even if
      we don&rsquo;t subscribe a penny ourselves&mdash;will be a great ornament to the
      town. You may not care for statues, Major, but all really cultivated
      people love them. Look at Dublin! It&rsquo;s a city with two universities in it,
      and the consequence is that it&rsquo;s simply spotted all over with statues.
      Look at ancient Athens, the most cultured city the world has ever seen.
      The number of statues the Athenians had would surprise you. Why shouldn&rsquo;t
      we have one? It&rsquo;ll do us all good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I call it a fraud,&rdquo; said the Major. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting money out of this fool
      of an American under false pretences. If this General of his wasn&rsquo;t born
      here&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now do you suppose, Major, that the General himself, the original John
      Regan, cares a pin where his statue is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he doesn&rsquo;t. The one thing we do know about him is that he&rsquo;s
      dead. Why should he care?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so. Then there&rsquo;s no fraud so far as he&rsquo;s concerned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t talking about him. I was talking about the American.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just coming to him. Billing wants a statue to the General. He wants
      it so much that he&rsquo;s prepared to pay £100 for it. He also believes that
      the General was born here. I think myself that he&rsquo;s mistaken about that;
      but there&rsquo;s no doubt he believes it. He&rsquo;ll be quite satisfied if we have
      the statue here. If we don&rsquo;t he&rsquo;ll have to go to a lot of trouble and
      expense looking up another birthplace for the General. When he finds one
      the people there may not be as civil and obliging as we are. Or they may
      have as many statues as they want already. I cannot for the life of me see
      that we&rsquo;re committing any kind of fraud when we&rsquo;re saving Billing a lot of
      expense, possibly a great disappointment, and allowing him to do exactly
      what he wants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Major Kent sighed hopelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use arguing with you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but you&rsquo;ll get us all into
      trouble before you&rsquo;ve done. You&rsquo;re absolutely certain to be found out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re beginning to talk sense,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;There is a
      certain risk of being found out. I don&rsquo;t deny that. What we have to do is
      to minimise it as far as possible. We must take care not to commit
      ourselves to any statement about the General&rsquo;s public career until we&rsquo;ve
      found out all we can about him. I intend to write to Dublin to-night for
      every book there is about Bolivia, which is the country he liberated. In
      the meanwhile we&rsquo;re fairly safe in working up any kind of local tradition
      we can think of. If that sort of thing is well done there&rsquo;s practically no
      risk of discovery. Even if the stories don&rsquo;t exactly fit in with what&rsquo;s
      known about the General&rsquo;s later life, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. The things that
      are told about the boyhood of great men are all invented afterwards.
      Nobody expects them to be true; but biographers have to put them in to
      satisfy the curiosity of the public. There must be a chapter headed &lsquo;Early
      Days,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Home Life,&rsquo; or something of that kind in every biography.
      That&rsquo;s the stuff Billing expects us to supply in exchange for the statue.
      At the same time men like Gallagher and Doyle are appallingly stupid, and
      I can&rsquo;t say you&rsquo;re exactly brilliant, Major. Any of you may, in an
      unguarded moment&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the Major, &ldquo;because I&rsquo;m going straight home and don&rsquo;t
      mean to leave the house again till this whole business is over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish that were possible,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;I should be much easier in
      my mind if you weren&rsquo;t here at all. But unfortunately we must have you.
      You give an air of solid respectability to the proceedings. You inspire
      confidence. We can&rsquo;t do without you. I&rsquo;ll get Gregg, the District
      Inspector, dragged into it too, and Ford, the Resident Magistrate, if I
      can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t get him. He has too much sense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get his wife anyway. She loves a fuss of any kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some of them will give you away,&rdquo; said the Major. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be found out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Gallagher gets through this afternoon,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;I shall
      feel pretty safe. I wish I hadn&rsquo;t been obliged to send Gallagher off alone
      with Billing. Poor Thady is such an ass. But what could I do? I couldn&rsquo;t
      go myself because I had to explain the situation to you and Doyle. I shall
      feel deeply thankful when Thady is safely home again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; said the Major, &ldquo;what was the explanation that you gave to
      Doyle? It was different from my one I know. I&rsquo;d rather like to hear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Doyle!&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;Do you know I felt quite sorry for him
      about that filly. He probably won&rsquo;t find out what&rsquo;s wrong with her for
      about a fortnight or three weeks. He&rsquo;ll be so busy over this General John
      Regan business that he won&rsquo;t have time to do anything with her. But when
      he does find out&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll not be the first man in Ireland,&rdquo; said the Major, &ldquo;who&rsquo;s been let
      in over a horse, and I don&rsquo;t pity him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;I pitied you, Major, when you were stuck and I
      helped you to get out I don&rsquo;t see why I shouldn&rsquo;t pity Doyle too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you mean to get him out?&rdquo; said the Major. &ldquo;Perhaps you intend to
      palm off that filly on your American.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;My idea is to get Doyle&rsquo;s money back for
      him out of the statue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Major thought this statement over and gradually came to suspect that
      O&rsquo;Grady contemplated some dishonourable use of public money. He was just
      beginning to make a violent protest when the door of the room in which
      they were sitting opened, and Gallagher came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;will you oblige me by coming over to the hotel at once
      and pacifying the American gentleman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought as much,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, jumping up. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve muddled things
      somehow, Thady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did the best I could,&rdquo; said Gallagher, &ldquo;but he wouldn&rsquo;t rest content
      with young Kerrigan&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;what on earth have you said? Young
      Kerrigan hasn&rsquo;t got a wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure I know that. But what was I to do? What I said was for the best. But
      anyway you&rsquo;d better come round to the hotel, till you see for yourself the
      way we&rsquo;re in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along, Major,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll enjoy watching us get out
      of this entanglement, whatever it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going with you,&rdquo; said the Major. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see any fun in standing
      still and listening to you telling lies to that American. It&rsquo;s not my idea
      of spending a pleasant afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, taking him by the arm. &ldquo;I may want you. I
      can&rsquo;t tell yet whether I shall or not, for I don&rsquo;t know yet what&rsquo;s
      happened. But I may.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Major hung back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady in a whisper, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell Doyle about the
      filly, all about her, and as you haven&rsquo;t got the money for her yet&mdash;well,
      you know what Doyle is. He&rsquo;s not the kind of man I&rsquo;d care to trust very
      far when he finds out that&mdash;Oh, do come on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It may have been this threat which overcame Major Kent&rsquo;s reluctance. It
      may have been a natural curiosity to find out what trouble Gallagher had
      got into with Mr. Billing: It may simply have been Dr. O&rsquo;Grady&rsquo;s force of
      character which vanquished him. He allowed himself to be led away.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now Thady,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;tell me exactly what happened and what the
      trouble is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was on account of my mentioning young Kerrigan&rsquo;s wife,&rdquo; said
      Gallagher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young Kerrigan hasn&rsquo;t got a wife,&rdquo; said the Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better begin at the beginning,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;If we knew how you
      arrived at whatever statement you made about young Kerrigan&rsquo;s wife we&rsquo;d be
      in a better position to judge what has to be done about it, Start off now
      at the moment when you went away in the motor-car. You went to Doyle&rsquo;s
      farm, I suppose, as I told you, so as to show Mr. Billing the General&rsquo;s
      birthplace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the latter end we got there,&rdquo; said Gallagher, &ldquo;but at the first go off
      I took him along the road past the workhouse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t quite the shortest route,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;In fact you
      began by going in exactly the opposite direction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After that we went round by Barney&rsquo;s Hill,&rdquo; said Gallagher, &ldquo;and along
      the bohireen by the side of the bog, me telling him the turns he ought to
      take.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth did you go there for,&rdquo; said the Major, &ldquo;if you wanted to
      get to Doyle&rsquo;s farm?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When we&rsquo;d passed the bog,&rdquo; said Gallagher, &ldquo;we took a twist round, like
      as we might be trying to cut across to the Dunbeg Road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to have gone pretty well all around the town,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady.
      &ldquo;I suppose you enjoyed driving about in a large motor. Was that it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was not,&rdquo; said Gallagher, &ldquo;but I was in dread to take him to Doyle&rsquo;s
      farm not knowing what questions he might be asking about the General when
      we got there. I&rsquo;d be glad now, doctor, if you&rsquo;d tell me who the General
      was, for it&rsquo;s troublesome not knowing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t time,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;to go into long explanations simply
      to satisfy your morbid curiosity. Go on with your story. What happened
      when you did get to the place? I suppose you got there in the end?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We did of course,&rdquo; said Gallagher, &ldquo;and I showed him the ruin of the
      little houseen, the same as you told me to. &lsquo;And was it there,&rsquo; says he,
      &lsquo;that the great General, the immortal founder of the liberties of Bolivia,
      first saw the light?&rsquo; &lsquo;It was,&rsquo; says I. So he took a leap out of the
      motor-car and stood in front of the old house with his hat in his hand. So
      I told him about the way the landlords had treated the people of this
      country in times past, and the way we are meaning to serve them out as
      soon as we have Home Rule, which is as good as got, only for the
      blackguards of Orangemen up in the North. I told him&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you did,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;but you needn&rsquo;t go over all that to
      us, particularly as the Major hates that kind of talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody,&rdquo; said Gallagher, &ldquo;would want to say a word that was displeasing
      to the Major, who is well liked in this locality and always was. If only
      the rest of the landlords was like him, instead of&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on about the American,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;did he throw stones at you
      while you were making that speech about Home Rule?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did not,&rdquo; said Gallagher, &ldquo;but he stood there looking at the houseen
      with the tears rolling down the cheeks of him&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;do you mean to tell me he cried?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was like as if he was going to,&rdquo; said Gallagher, &ldquo;and &lsquo;the patriot
      statesman,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;the mighty warrior,&rsquo; says he, and more to that, the
      same as if he might be making a speech about the land and the league boys
      cheering him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m rather bothered about that American in some ways,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady.
      &ldquo;Are you telling me the truth now, Thady, about what he said?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; said Gallagher. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d take my oath to every word of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Either he&rsquo;s a much greater fool than he looks,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;or
      else&mdash;but I&rsquo;ll find that out afterwards. Go on with your story,
      Thady. What happened next?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, after he&rsquo;d cried about a saucerful&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you said he didn&rsquo;t actually cry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was like as if he was going to cry. I told you that before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on, O&rsquo;Grady,&rdquo; said the Major. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of listening to this
      sort of stuff?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be quiet, Major,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re just coming to the point. Go
      ahead, Thady. You&rsquo;d just got to the saucerful of tears. When he&rsquo;d emptied
      that out, what did he do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He asked me,&rdquo; said Gallagher, &ldquo;was there any relatives or friends of the
      General surviving in the locality? He had me beat there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you told him there were several,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did, of course. Is it likely I&rsquo;d disappoint the gentleman, and him set
      on finding someone belonging to the General? &lsquo;Who are they?&rsquo; said he.
      &lsquo;Tell me their names,&rsquo; Well, it was there I made the mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a bit awkward,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;when you didn&rsquo;t know who the
      General was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I thought to myself,&rdquo; said Gallagher, &ldquo;was this. There might be many
      a one in the locality that would be glad enough to be a cousin of the
      General&rsquo;s, even if there was no money to be got out of it, and it could be
      that there would. But, not knowing much about the General, I wasn&rsquo;t easy
      in my mind for fear that anybody I named might be terrible angry with me
      after for giving them a cousin that might be some sort of a disgrace to
      the family&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see now,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;You thought it safer to name somebody who
      didn&rsquo;t exist. But what made you think of a wife for young Kerrigan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the first thing came into my head,&rdquo; said Gallagher, &ldquo;and I was
      that flustered I said it without thinking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, how did he take it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was mighty pleased, so he was. &lsquo;Take me to her,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Take me to
      see her this minute,&rsquo; Well, to be sure I couldn&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could not,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;Could he, Major?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why not. He might have hired some girl for half an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No decent girl would do it,&rdquo; said Gallagher, &ldquo;and anyway I wouldn&rsquo;t have
      had the time, for he had me in the motor again before I knew where he was
      and &lsquo;Show me the way to the house,&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t see her at the
      present time,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;though you may later,&rsquo; &lsquo;And why not?&rsquo; says he.
      &lsquo;The reason why you can&rsquo;t,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;is a delicate matter,&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; says he.
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the way of it, is it? I&rsquo;m glad to hear of it. The more of the
      stock of the old General there are in the world the better.&rsquo; Well, when I
      seen him so pleased as all that, I thought it would be no harm to please
      him more. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s twins,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;and what&rsquo;s more the both of them is
      boys,&rsquo; &lsquo;Take me to see the father,&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll be able to see him
      anyway. I&rsquo;d like to shake him by the hand.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he seen young Kerrigan?&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has not; but he won&rsquo;t rest easy till he does. I wanted to run round
      and tell young Kerrigan the way things are, so as he&rsquo;d be ready when the
      gentleman came. But Doyle said it would be better for me to tell you what
      had happened before worse came of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doyle was perfectly right Kerrigan would stand over your story all right
      as long as he could, but in the end he&rsquo;d have had to produce the twins.
      That&rsquo;s the awkward part. If you hadn&rsquo;t said twins we might have managed.
      But there isn&rsquo;t a pair in the town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you telegraph to Dublin?&rdquo; said the Major. &ldquo;For a man of your
      resource, O&rsquo;Grady, mere twins ought not to prove a hopeless obstacle. I
      should think that one of the hospitals where they go in for that kind of
      thing would be quite glad to let you have a brace of babies in or about
      the same age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      O&rsquo;Grady knew that this suggestion was not meant to be helpful. The Major
      had an objectionable habit of indulging in heavy sarcasm. He turned on him
      sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better go home, Major. When you try to be facetious you altogether
      cease to be useful. You know perfectly well that there&rsquo;s no use talking
      about importing babies. What would we do with them afterwards? You
      couldn&rsquo;t expect young Kerrigan to keep them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I offered to go home some time ago,&rdquo; said the Major, &ldquo;and you wouldn&rsquo;t
      let me. Now that I&rsquo;ve heard about young Kerrigan&rsquo;s twins I mean to stop
      where I am and see what happens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, Major. Just as you like. As long as you don&rsquo;t upset Billing by
      rolling up any of those heavy jokes of yours against him I don&rsquo;t mind.
      Here we are. I expect Doyle has Billing in the bar trying to pacify him
      with whisky. You&rsquo;d better stay outside, Thady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be glad of a drop then,&rdquo; said Gallagher wistfully. &ldquo;After all the
      talking I did this afternoon&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, go in if you like,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;Probably the safest thing for
      you to do is to get drunk. Here&rsquo;s Billing crossing the street He&rsquo;s just
      come out of Kerrigan&rsquo;s shop. Why on earth Doyle couldn&rsquo;t have kept him in
      play till I came.... He&rsquo;s sure to have found out now that young Kerrigan
      isn&rsquo;t married. This will make my explanation far more difficult than it
      need have been.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will make it impossible, I should imagine,&rdquo; said the Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Billing, his hands in his coat pockets and a large cigar between his
      teeth, came jauntily across the street. Dr. O&rsquo;Grady greeted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-evening, Mr. Billing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ve had a pleasant and
      satisfactory afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sergeant Colgan and Constable Moriarty came out of the barrack together.
      They joined the group opposite the hotel. Constable Moriarty was grinning
      broadly. He had evidently heard some version of the story about young
      Kerrigan&rsquo;s twins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry to find,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;that Thady Gallagher made a
      mistake, and a bad one, this afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon,&rdquo; said Mr. Billing, &ldquo;that he kind of wandered from the path of
      truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young Kerrigan isn&rsquo;t married,&rdquo; said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The twins,&rdquo; said Mr. Billing, &ldquo;were an effort of imagination. I am a man
      of imagination myself, so I&rsquo;m not complaining any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Being a newspaper editor you have to be, of course,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady.
      &ldquo;But Gallagher&rsquo;s story wasn&rsquo;t pure imagination. It was rather what I&rsquo;d
      call prophetic. The fact is young Kerrigan is going to be married.
      Gallagher only anticipated things a bit. I daresay he thought the ceremony
      had really taken place. He didn&rsquo;t mean to deceive you in any way. Did you,
      Thady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked round as he spoke. He wanted Gallagher to confirm what he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s within,&rdquo; said Constable Moriarty, grinning, &ldquo;and I wouldn&rsquo;t say but
      he&rsquo;s having a drink. Anyway, here&rsquo;s Mr. Doyle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doyle, having supplied Gallagher with a bottle of porter, came out of the
      hotel. He was naturally anxious to hear Dr. O&rsquo;Grady&rsquo;s explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The twins,&rdquo; said Mr. Billing, &ldquo;were considerable previous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so much as you might think,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;Once people get
      married, you know, Mr. Billing, it often happens&mdash;generally in fact&mdash;not
      necessarily twins, but more or less that kind of thing. I can quite
      understand Thady making the mistake. And the girl young Kerrigan&rsquo;s going
      to marry really is a grandniece of the General&rsquo;s. Thady was quite right
      there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see her,&rdquo; said Mr. Billing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to take a photograph of
      her. The Bolivian public will be interested in a photograph of General
      John Regan&rsquo;s grandniece.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run and get your camera then,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have her ready for
      you by the time you&rsquo;re back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Billing, looking very well satisfied and quite without suspicion, went
      into the hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doyle,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;fetch Mary Ellen as quick as you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it Mary Ellen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is. Get her at once, and don&rsquo;t argue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But sure Mary Ellen&rsquo;s not the grandniece of any General.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s the only grandniece we can possibly get on such short notice,&rdquo; said
      Dr. O&rsquo;Grady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Sergeant Colgan, &ldquo;will Mr. Gallagher be too well
      pleased. Mary Ellen&rsquo;s a cousin of his own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thady will have to put up with a little inconvenience,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady.
      &ldquo;He got us all into this mess, so he can&rsquo;t complain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, doctor,&rdquo; said Constable Moriarty, who had stopped
      grinning and looked truculent, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll not have it put out that Mary
      Ellen&rsquo;s going to marry young Kerrigan. He&rsquo;s a boy she never looked at, nor
      wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut up, Moriarty,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;If you won&rsquo;t call her, Doyle, I
      must do it myself. Mary Ellen, Mary Ellen, come here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of calling Mary Ellen?&rdquo; said Doyle. &ldquo;The girl knows well
      enough she&rsquo;s not the niece nor the grandniece of any General. As soon as
      ever you face her with the American gentleman she&rsquo;ll be saying something,
      be the same more or less, that&rsquo;ll let him know the way things are with
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I know anything of Mary Ellen,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;she&rsquo;ll not say a
      word more than she need on any subject. I never could drag anything beyond
      &lsquo;I did,&rsquo; or &lsquo;I did not,&rsquo; or &lsquo;I might,&rsquo; out of her no matter how hard I
      tried, Mary Ellen! Mary Ellen! Ah! here she is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary Ellen came slowly through the door of the hotel. She smiled when she
      saw Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, smiled again and then blushed when her eyes lit on
      Constable Moriarty. Her face and hands were a little dirtier than they had
      been earlier in the day, but she had added a small, crumpled, white cap to
      the apron which she put on in honour of Mr. Billing. The sight of her
      roused all Constable Moriarty&rsquo;s spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not have it done, doctor,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;so there it is for you plain
      and straight. I&rsquo;ll not stand by and see the character of a decent girl&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whisht, can&rsquo;t you,&rdquo; said Mary Ellen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sergeant,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;this isn&rsquo;t a matter in which the police
      have any business to interfere. No one is committing a crime of any sort.
      You&rsquo;d far better send Moriarty back to the barrack before he makes a worse
      fool of himself than he has already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get along home out of that, Moriarty,&rdquo; said the sergeant. &ldquo;Do you want me
      to have to report you to the District Inspector for neglect of duty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The threat was a terrific one. Moriarty quailed before it. He did not
      actually go back to the barrack; but he retired to the background and did
      no more than look reproachfully at Mary Ellen whenever he thought she was
      looking his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great pity,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;that we haven&rsquo;t time to wash her
      face. I might do something, even without soap and water, if I had a
      pocket-handkerchief. Major, just lend me&mdash;&mdash; Oh hang it! I
      can&rsquo;t. Here comes Billing with his camera. Pull yourself together now,
      Mary Ellen, and try to look as if you were proud of your distinguished
      relative. It isn&rsquo;t every girl of your age who has a General for a great
      uncle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Billing approached. The corners of his lips were twitching in a
      curious way. Dr. O&rsquo;Grady looked at him suspiciously. A casual observer
      might have supposed that Mr. Billing was trying hard not to smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, pointing to Mary Ellen, &ldquo;is the grandniece, the
      only surviving relative, of General John Regan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You surprise me,&rdquo; said Mr. Billing. &ldquo;When I recollect that she cooked
      chops for my luncheon to-day I&rsquo;m amazed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The General wouldn&rsquo;t have thought a bit the worse of her for that,&rdquo; said
      Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;A true democrat, the General, if ever there was one. I
      daresay he often cooked chops himself, when campaigning I mean, and was
      jolly glad to get chops to cook.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you,&rdquo; said Mr. Billing, addressing Mary Ellen, &ldquo;are the grandniece of
      the great General?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might be,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I am to have the privilege&mdash;gentlemen, please stand a little
      aside. I wish to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Billing set up his camera and put his head under the black cloth.
      Constable Moriarty sidled up to Major Kent. Nothing had been said about
      Mary Ellen&rsquo;s marriage with young Kerrigan. He felt that he had been
      unnecessarily alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, Major,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but maybe if you asked the gentleman
      he&rsquo;d give me a copy of the photo when it&rsquo;s took.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talk to the doctor about that,&rdquo; said the Major. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s managing this show.
      I&rsquo;ve nothing to do with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be backward about asking the doctor,&rdquo; said Moriarty, &ldquo;on account of
      what passed between us a minute ago when I thought he was wanting to take
      away the girl&rsquo;s character.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Billing completed his arrangements and stood beside his camera ready
      to release the shutter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re quite sure,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;that you wouldn&rsquo;t care to have her
      face washed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certain,&rdquo; said Mr. Billing. &ldquo;The General was a genuine democrat if ever
      there was one. He wouldn&rsquo;t have thought a bit the worse of her for having
      a dirty face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. O&rsquo;Grady started slightly and then looked questioningly at Mr. Billing.
      It struck him that there was something suspicious about this repetition of
      his words. He glanced at the Major, at Doyle, and then at the two
      policemen. They all seemed completely absorbed in the taking of the
      photograph. Mr. Billing&rsquo;s last remark had not struck them as in any way
      odd.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shutter clicked. One of Mary Ellen&rsquo;s sweetest smiles was secured on
      the sensitive plate. Constable Moriarty, greatly daring, asked Mr. Billing
      for a print of the photograph. Mr. Billing promised him a copy of the life
      of General John Regan when it appeared. He said that there would be a full
      page reproduction of Mary Ellen&rsquo;s portrait in the second volume.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Major and I must be off,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;but if I may call on you
      to-morrow morning, Mr. Billing, I should like to make arrangements about
      the public meeting. We want to have you at it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The meeting?&rdquo; said Doyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The meeting about the statue,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;By the way, Doyle, you
      might call on Father McCormack this evening.&rdquo; He spoke with a glance at
      Mr. Billing which he hoped that Doyle would interpret correctly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d
      better remind him that he&rsquo;s to take the chair. He promised a week ago, but
      he may have forgotten. That&rsquo;s the worst of these good-natured men,&rdquo; he
      added, speaking directly to Mr. Billing. &ldquo;They promise anything, and then
      it&rsquo;s ten to one they forget all about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not quite sure,&rdquo; said Mr. Billing, &ldquo;that my arrangements will allow
      me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, they will if you squeeze them a bit. Arrangements are extraordinary
      pliable things if you handle them firmly, and we&rsquo;d like to have you. A
      speech from you about the General would be most interesting. It would
      stimulate the whole population. Wouldn&rsquo;t it, Major?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to hear it,&rdquo; said the Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye then, for the present,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;Come along, Major. By
      the way, Doyle, if Thady takes a drop too much to drink, and he may, don&rsquo;t
      let him start boring Mr. Billing about Home Rule.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took Major Kent by the arm and walked off. Until they passed the end of
      the street and were well out on the lonely road which led to the Major&rsquo;s
      house, neither of them spoke. Then the Major broke the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope, O&rsquo;Grady, that you&rsquo;re satisfied with that performance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To tell you the truth, Major, I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised to hear that,&rdquo; said the Major. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve told the most
      outrageous lies I ever heard. You&rsquo;ve&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I gave the only possible explanation of a rather difficult situation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve made a laughing stock of a respectable girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve given Mary Ellen a great uncle that she ought to be proud to own.
      That&rsquo;s not what&rsquo;s bothering me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That American,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t at all like the way he&rsquo;s going
      on. He&rsquo;s not by any means a fool&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must be or he wouldn&rsquo;t have swallowed all those lies you told him in
      the way he did. How could Mary Ellen possibly be&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;He swallowed what I said far too
      easily. The situation, owing to Thady Gallagher&rsquo;s want of presence of
      mind, was complex, desperately complex. I got out of it as well as any man
      could, but I don&rsquo;t deny that the explanation I gave&mdash;particularly
      that part about Mary Ellen being engaged to young Kerrigan, was a bit
      strained. I expected the American would have shied. But he didn&rsquo;t. He
      swallowed it whole without so much as a choke. Now I don&rsquo;t think that was
      quite natural. The fact is, Major, I&rsquo;m uneasy about Billing. It struck me
      that there was something rather odd in the way he repeated my words about
      the General being a genuine democrat. He gave me the impression that he
      was&mdash;well, trying to make fools of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were certainly trying to make a fool of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite understand his game,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;if he has a game.
      I may be wronging him. He may be simply an idiot, a well-meaning idiot
      with a craze for statues.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must be,&rdquo; said the Major. &ldquo;Nothing else would account for&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doubt it,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t look that kind of man.
      However, there&rsquo;s no use talking any more about it to-night. I&rsquo;ll be in a
      better position to judge when I&rsquo;ve found out all there is to know about
      this General of his. I&rsquo;ll write for the books I&rsquo;ve mentioned, and I&rsquo;ll
      write to a man I know in the National Library. If there&rsquo;s anything known
      about the General on this side of the Atlantic he&rsquo;ll ferret it out for
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. O&rsquo;Grady stopped speaking. The Major supposed that he had stopped
      thinking about Mr. Billing&rsquo;s curious conduct. The doctor did indeed intend
      to stop thinking about it. But it is difficult to bridle thought. After
      walking half a mile in silence Dr. O&rsquo;Grady spoke again, and his words
      showed that his mind was still working on the same problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Americans have far too good an opinion of themselves,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Billing
      may possibly think he&rsquo;s playing some kind of trick on us. He may be
      laughing at us in some way we don&rsquo;t quite understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether he&rsquo;s laughing or not,&rdquo; said the Major, &ldquo;but
      everybody else will be very soon if you go on as you&rsquo;re going.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is very difficult to do anything of importance to the community without
      holding a public meeting about it. In Ireland people have got so
      accustomed to oratory and the resolutions which are the immediate excuse
      for oratory, that public meetings are absolutely necessary preliminaries
      to any enterprise. This is the case in all four provinces, which is one of
      the things which goes to show that the Irish are really a single people
      and not two or three different peoples, as some writers assert. The
      hard-headed, commercially-minded Ulsterman is just as fond of public
      meetings as the Connacht Celt. He would hold them, with drums and full
      dress speechifying, even if he were organising a secret society and
      arranging for a rebellion. He is perfectly right. Without a public meeting
      it would be impossible to enrol any large number of members for a society.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, having lived all his life in Ireland, and being on most
      intimate terms with his neighbours, understood this law. He also
      understood that in order to make a success of a public meeting in Connacht
      and therefore to further the enterprise on hand, it is necessary that the
      parish priest should take the chair and advisable that a Member of
      Parliament should propose the first resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began by sending Doyle to Father McCormack. Doyle, foreseeing a
      possible profit for himself, did his best to persuade Father McCormack to
      take the chair. Father McCormack, who was a fat man and therefore
      good-natured, did not want to refuse Doyle. But Father McCormack was not a
      free agent. Behind him, somewhere, was a bishop, reputed to be austere,
      certainly domineering. Father McCormack was very much afraid of the
      bishop, therefore he hesitated. The most that Doyle could secure, after a
      long interview, was the promise of a definite answer the next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father McCormack made use of the twenty-four hours&rsquo; grace he had secured
      by calling on Major Kent. The Major was a Protestant, with strong
      anti-Papal convictions, and therefore was not, it might have been
      supposed, a good man to advise a priest on a delicate question of
      ecclesiastical etiquette. But the Major was eminently respectable, and his
      outlook upon life was staidly conservative. Father McCormack felt that if
      Major Kent thoroughly approved of the erection of a statue to General John
      Regan it was likely to be quite a proper thing to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure,&rdquo; said Father McCormack, &ldquo;whether it will suit me to take
      the chair at this meeting the doctor&rsquo;s getting up or not. I&rsquo;m not sure, I
      say. Can you tell me now, Major Kent, who&rsquo;s this American gentleman
      they&rsquo;re all talking about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything about him,&rdquo; said the Major, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m bound to say
      he looks like a Protestant. I don&rsquo;t know whether that will make any
      difference to you or not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the little I&rsquo;ve seen of him&mdash;just across the street from the
      window of the Presbytery&mdash;I&rsquo;d say you were right about his religion,
      but I needn&rsquo;t tell you, Major Kent, that I&rsquo;m not a bigoted man. It
      wouldn&rsquo;t stop me taking the chair if he was a Protestant. It wouldn&rsquo;t stop
      me if he was a Presbyterian, and I can&rsquo;t say more than that. You know very
      well that I&rsquo;d just as soon be sitting on a committee alongside of a
      Protestant as any ordinary kind of man. I&rsquo;m not one that would let
      religion interfere too much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seems quite respectable,&rdquo; said the Major. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been here three days
      now, and I never saw him drunk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that either that&rsquo;s troubling me,&rdquo; said Father McCormack.
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s many a man gets drunk when he can, and I&rsquo;d be the last to make
      too much out of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you any more about him,&rdquo; said the Major, &ldquo;for that&rsquo;s all I
      know, except that he appears to be rich.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The difficulty I&rsquo;m in is on account of the bishop. He&rsquo;s getting to be
      mighty particular. I don&rsquo;t say he&rsquo;s wrong, mind you; only there it is. But
      sure, if no one in the place has anything to say against the American
      gentleman it&rsquo;s likely he&rsquo;ll turn out to be all right. But what about the
      fellow they want to put up the statue to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;General John Regan,&rdquo; said the Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about him? I never heard tell of him before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the matter of that, nor did I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was he at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to ask Dr. O&rsquo;Grady that. He&rsquo;s the only man who professes to
      know anything about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I was saying to you this minute,&rdquo; said Father McCormack, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t
      mind if he was a Protestant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He hardly could be,&rdquo; said the Major, &ldquo;with that name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s many a Protestant that might be just as well deserving of a
      statue as maybe a bishop. But what I&rsquo;m afraid of is that this fellow might
      be worse. For let me tell you, Major, there&rsquo;s worse things than
      Protestants, and I&rsquo;m not saying that just because I&rsquo;m talking to you. I&rsquo;d
      say it to anyone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This gratified Major Kent, but it did not enable him to give any
      information about General John Regan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no use asking me about him,&rdquo; he said wearily. &ldquo;Ask Dr. O&rsquo;Grady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it was to turn out at the latter end,&rdquo; said Faflier McCormack, &ldquo;that
      he was one of those French atheists, or if he had any hand in hunting the
      nuns out of Portugal, the bishop wouldn&rsquo;t be too well pleased when he
      heard that I&rsquo;d been helping to put up a statue to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to ask Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. It&rsquo;s no good asking me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you tell me this, Major Kent, and I won&rsquo;t ask you another question.
      Are you going to the meeting yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well now, you&rsquo;re a man with a position in the place and you wouldn&rsquo;t be
      going to a meeting of the sort unless it was all right. I&rsquo;m inclined to
      think now that if you&rsquo;re going&mdash;I wouldn&rsquo;t give a thraneen for what
      Doyle might do. If that fellow saw half a chance of making sixpence by
      going to a meeting he&rsquo;d go, if it was held for the purpose of breaking the
      windows of the Presbytery. That&rsquo;s the sort of man Doyle is. And I wouldn&rsquo;t
      mind Thady Gallagher. Thady is a kind-hearted poor fellow, though he&rsquo;s a
      bit foolish at times; but he&rsquo;s not the sort of man you could trust. He&rsquo;s
      too fond of politics, and that&rsquo;s a fact. Give Thady the opportunity of
      making a speech and you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to keep him at home from a
      meeting, whatever sort of a meeting it might be. But it&rsquo;s different with
      you, Major Kent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Major was deeply touched by this eulogy; so deeply touched that he
      felt it wrong to leave Father McCormack under the impression that he was
      going to the meeting out of any feeling of admiration for General John
      Regan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I wouldn&rsquo;t go near the meeting if I could
      help it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there anything against that General then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that. It&rsquo;s simply that I loathe and detest all public meetings,
      and I wouldn&rsquo;t go to this one or any other if I could get out of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why can&rsquo;t you get out of it? A man needn&rsquo;t go to a meeting unless he
      likes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must,&rdquo; said the Major, &ldquo;I must; any man must, if Dr. O&rsquo;Grady gets at
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, too,&rdquo; said Father McCormack, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t mind telling you
      that I&rsquo;ve been keeping out of the doctor&rsquo;s way ever since Doyle asked me.
      I&rsquo;d rather not see him till I have my mind made up the one way or the
      other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was unfortunate for Father McCormack that Dr. O&rsquo;Grady should at that
      moment have walked into the Major&rsquo;s study without even knocking at the
      door. He had just received answers to his letters from four of the most
      eminent Irish Members of Parliament He had asked them all to attend a
      meeting at Ballymoy and make speeches about General John Regan. They had
      all refused, offering the very flimsiest excuses. Dr. O&rsquo;Grady was
      extremely indignant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what on earth use there is,&rdquo; he blurted out, &ldquo;in our keeping
      Members of Parliament at all. Here we are paying these fellows £400 a year
      each, and when we ask for a perfectly simple speech&mdash;&mdash; Oh, I
      beg your pardon, Father McCormack, I didn&rsquo;t see you were here. But I
      daresay you quite agree with me. Every one must.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father McCormack came here,&rdquo; said the Major, &ldquo;to ask about General John
      Regan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is he at all?&rdquo; said the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A general,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;Irish extraction. Born in Ballymoy. Rose
      to great eminence in Bolivia. Finally secured the liberty of the
      Republic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father McCormack seems to think,&rdquo; said the Major, &ldquo;that he was some kind
      of anti-clerical socialist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said he might be,&rdquo; said Father McCormack. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say he was, for I
      don&rsquo;t know a ha&rsquo;porth about him. All I said was that if he turned out to
      be that kind of a man it wouldn&rsquo;t suit me to be putting up statues to him.
      The Bishop wouldn&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My impression is&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;Mind, I don&rsquo;t
      say I&rsquo;m perfectly certain of it, but my impression is that he built a
      cathedral before he died. Anyhow I never heard or read a single word
      against his character as a religious man. He may have been a little&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       Dr. O&rsquo;Grady winked slowly. &ldquo;You know the kind of thing I mean, Father
      McCormack, when he was young. Most military men are, more or less. I
      expect now that the Major could tell us some queer stories about the sort
      of thing that goes on&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In garrison towns,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady persuasively, &ldquo;and of course it&rsquo;s
      worse on active service. Come now, Major, I&rsquo;m not asking you to give
      yourself away, but you could&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the Major firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you mean is that you wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;Not while Father
      McCormack is listening to you anyhow. And you may take my word for it that
      the old General was just the same. He may have been a bit of a lad in his
      early days&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t mind that,&rdquo; said Father McCormack. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t mind that if it
      was twice as much, so long&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he&rsquo;d never have said anything really disrespectful in the presence of
      a clergyman of any denomination. Whatever his faults were&mdash;and he had
      faults, of course&mdash;he wasn&rsquo;t that kind of man. So you needn&rsquo;t
      hesitate about taking the chair at the meeting, Father McCormack. I defy
      the most particular bishop that ever wore a purple stock to find out
      anything really bad about the General.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I have your word for that,&rdquo; said Father McCormack, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m satisfied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a rich man,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t afford to lose money, but
      I&rsquo;ll pay down £50 to any man who proves anything bad about the General.
      And when I say bad I don&rsquo;t, mean things like&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand you,&rdquo; said Father McCormack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;atheism of a blatant kind, or circulating
      immoral literature&mdash;Sunday papers, for instance&mdash;or wanting to
      turn the priests out of the schools, or not paying his dues&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand you,&rdquo; said Father McCormack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what I&rsquo;m talking about,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;for I&rsquo;ve had a man
      looking up all that&rsquo;s known about General John Regan in the National
      Library in Dublin.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      At the very bottom of the main street of Ballymoy, close to the little
      harbour where the fishing boats nestled together in stormy weather, there
      is a disused mill. Corn was ground in it long ago. The farmers brought it
      from the country round about after the threshing was over, and the stream
      which now flows idly into the sea was then kept busy turning a large
      wheel. Since the Americans have taken to supplying Ireland with flour
      ready ground, bleached, and fit for immediate use, the Irish farmers have
      left off growing wheat. Being wise men they see no sense in toiling when
      other people are willing to toil instead of them. The Ballymoy mill, and
      many others like it, lie idle. They are slipping quietly through the
      gradual stages of decay and will one day become economically valuable to
      the country again as picturesque ruins. Few things are more attractive to
      tourists than ruins, and the country which possesses an abundance of them
      is in a fair way to grow rich easily. But it is necessary that the ruins
      should be properly matured. No man with an educated taste for food will
      eat Stilton cheese which is only half decayed. No educated tourist will
      take long journeys and pay hotel bills in order to look at an immature
      ruin. The decaying mills of Ireland have not yet reached the profitable
      stage of development. Their doors and windows are still boarded up. Their
      walls are adorned with posters instead of ivy. No aesthetic archaeologist
      has as yet written a book about their architecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Ballymoy mill was the property of Doyle. He bought it very cheap when
      the previous owner, a son of the last miller, lapsed into bankruptcy. He
      saw no immediate prospect of making money out of it, but he was one of
      those men&mdash;they generally end in being moderately rich&mdash;who
      believe that all real property will in the end acquire a value, if only it
      is possessed with sufficient patience. In the meanwhile, since buildings
      do not eat, and so long as they remain empty are not liable for rates, the
      mill did not cost Doyle anything. He tried several times to organise
      schemes by means of which he might be able to secure a rent for the mill.
      When it became fashionable, eight or ten years ago, to start what are
      tailed &ldquo;industries&rdquo; in Irish provincial towns, Doyle suggested that his
      mill should be turned into a bacon factory. A public meeting was held with
      Father McCormack in the chair, and Thady Gallagher made an eloquent
      speech. Doyle himself offered to take shares in the new company to the
      amount of £5. Father McCormack, who was named as a director, also took
      five £1 shares. It was agreed that Doyle should be paid £30 a year for the
      mill. At that point the scheme broke down, mainly because no one else
      would take any shares at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      A couple of years later Doyle tried again. This time he suggested a
      stocking manufactory. Stockings are supposed to require less capital than
      bacon curing, and, as worked out on paper, they promise large profits.
      Doyle offered the mill for £25 a year this time, and was greatly praised
      by Thady Gallagher in the columns of the <i>Connacht Eagle</i> for his
      patriotic self-sacrifice. Another large meeting was held, but once more
      the public, though enthusiastic about the scheme, failed to subscribe the
      capital. A great effort was made the next year to induce the Government to
      buy the building for a £1,000, with a view to turning it into a Technical
      School. A petition was signed by almost everyone in Ballymoy setting forth
      the hungry desire of the people for instruction in the arts of life.
      Several Members of Parliament asked the Chief Secretary searching
      questions on the subject of the Ballymoy Technical School. But the Chief
      Secretary declared himself quite unable to wring the money out of the
      Treasury. Thady Gallagher wrote articles and made speeches which ought to
      have caused acute discomfort to the Prime Minister. But Doyle found
      himself obliged to give up the idea of a Technical School. He waited
      hopefully. In the end, he felt sure, some way of utilising the old mill
      would be found. In the meanwhile the building, though unprofitable to
      Doyle was not entirely useless. Its walls, boarded doors and windows,
      formed the most excellent place for the display of advertisements. The
      circuses which visited the town in summer covered a great deal of space
      with their posters. When retiring members of the Urban District Council
      wanted to be re-elected they notified their desire by means of placards
      pasted on the walls of Doyle&rsquo;s mill. All public meetings were advertised
      there. Doyle himself made nothing out of these advertisements; but Thady
      Gallagher did. He printed the posters, and it was admitted by everyone
      that he did it very well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days after his arrival in Ballymoy, Mr. Billing strolled down to the
      harbour. He was a man of restless and energetic disposition, but the
      visits which he received from Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, and the speeches about Home
      Rule to which Gallagher subjected him, began to worry him. In order to
      soothe his nerves he used to spend an hour or two morning and evening
      looking at the fishermen who spent the day in contemplating their boats.
      There is nothing in the world more soothing than the study of a
      fisherman&rsquo;s life on shore. When he is at sea it is probably strenuous
      enough. But then he very seldom is at sea, and when he is he is out of
      sight. Having, so to speak, drunk deeply of the torpor of Ballymoy
      harbour, Mr. Billing turned his face towards the shore and looked at the
      wall of Doyle&rsquo;s mill. He was startled to find six new posters stuck on it
      in a row. They were all bright green. Mr. Billing read them with interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The announcement opened with a prayer, printed in large type:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
               &ldquo;GOD SAVE IRELAND,&rdquo;
 
               GENERAL JOHN REGAN
</pre>
    <p>
      This was repeated at the bottom of each poster in the Irish language,
      which Mr. Billing could not read. Next to the prayer, in very much larger
      type, came the words:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
               &ldquo;A PUBLIC MEETING,&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Then, in quite small letters:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        &ldquo;WILL BE HELD ON TUESDAY NEXT AT 3 P. M.
    IN THE MARKET  SQUARE,  OPPOSITE  THE  &lsquo;IMPERIAL  HOTEL.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Mr. Billing read on and learned that Father McCormack would take the
      chair, that several distinguished Members of Parliament would address the
      meeting, that Mr. T. Gallagher, Chairman U. D. C., would also speak, and
      that&mdash;here the letters became immense&mdash;Mr. Horace P. Billing, of
      Bolivia, would give an account of the life of General John Regan, in whose
      honour it was proposed to erect a statue in Ballymoy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Billing smiled. Then he turned and walked briskly to the hotel. He
      found Doyle and Thady Gallagher seated together on the bench outside the
      door. He addressed them cheerfully:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that doctor of yours seems to have got a move
      on this locality. The announcement of the meeting is a good thing, sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The doctor,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;is a fine man; but it would be better for him
      if he&rsquo;d pay what he owes. I&rsquo;m tired, so I am, of trying to get my money
      out of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The doctor,&rdquo; said Gallagher, &ldquo;has the good of the locality at heart, and
      whatever it might be that he takes in hand will be carried through. You
      may rely on the doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thady Gallagher had not yet been paid for printing the green posters. But
      he had every hope he would be when Mr. Billing handed over his
      subscription to the statue fund. He felt, it right to do all in his power
      to encourage Mr. Billing. Doyle, on the other hand, was becoming
      despondent. He did not like to see money which ought to be his frittered
      away on posters and the other necessary expenses of a public meeting. He
      was much less inclined to admire, the doctor&rsquo;s enterprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess,&rdquo; said Mr. Billing, &ldquo;that these Congressmen will draw some.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you mean the Members of Parliament,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;the doctor told me
      this morning that they said they&rsquo;d more to do than to be attending his
      meetings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It could be,&rdquo; said Gallagher hopefully, &ldquo;that one of them might.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will not,&rdquo; said Doyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do without them,&rdquo; said Mr. Billing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what the doctor said to me,&rdquo; said Gallagher. &ldquo;&lsquo;We&rsquo;ll do without
      them, Thady,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;so long as we have Mr. Billing and Father
      McCormack and yourself,&rsquo; meaning me, &lsquo;we&rsquo;ll have a good meeting if there
      never was a Member of Parliament near it.&rsquo; And that&rsquo;s true too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the doctor,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;would pay what he owes instead of wasting
      his time over public meetings and statues and the like it would be better.
      Not that I&rsquo;d say a word against the statue, or, for the matter of that,
      against the doctor, who&rsquo;s well liked in the town by all classes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Tuesday fixed for the meeting was a well chosen day. It was the
      occasion of one of the largest fairs held in Ballymoy during the year. The
      country people, small farmers and their wives, flock into the town
      whenever there is a fair. The streets are thronged with cattle lowing
      miserably. &ldquo;Buyers,&rdquo; men whose business it is to carry the half-fed
      Connacht beasts to the fattening pastures of Meath and Kildare, assemble
      in large numbers and haggle over prices from early dawn till noon. No
      better occasion for the exploitation of a cause could possibly be chosen.
      And three o&rsquo;clock was a very good hour. By that time the business of the
      fair is well over. The buying and selling is finished. But no one has gone
      home, and no one is more than partially drunk. It is safe to expect that
      everybody will welcome the entertainment that a meeting affords during the
      dull time which must intervene between the finishing of the day&rsquo;s business
      and the weary journey home.
    </p>
    <p>
      The green posters were distributed far and wide. They adorned every
      gatepost and every wall sufficiently smooth to hold them within a circle
      of three miles radius around the town. There was some talk beforehand
      about the meeting. But on the whole the people displayed very little
      curiosity about General John Regan. It was taken for granted that he had
      been in some way associated with the cause of Irish Nationality, and one
      or two people professed to recollect that he had fought on the side of the
      Boers during the South African War. Whoever he was, the people were
      inclined to support the movement for erecting a statue to him by cheering
      anything which Thady Gallagher said. But they did not intend to support it
      in any other way. The Connacht farmer is like the rest of the human race
      in his dislike of being asked to subscribe to anything. He is superior to
      most other men in his capacity for resisting the pressure of the
      subscription list.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the Saturday before the meeting Gallagher published a long article on
      the subject of the General in the <i>Connacht Eagle</i>. It was read, as
      all Gallagher&rsquo;s articles were, with respectful attention. Everybody
      expected to find out by reading it who the General was. Everyone felt, as
      he read it, or listened to it read aloud, that he was learning all he
      wanted to know, and did not discover until he came to talk the matter over
      afterwards with his friends that he knew no more when he had read the
      article than he did before.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not Thady Gallagher but Dr. O&rsquo;Grady who wrote the article. Thady
      made several attempts and then gave up the matter in despair. Dr. O&rsquo;Grady,
      though he was extremely busy at the time, had to do the writing. It was
      very well done, and calculated to heat to the boiling point the enthusiasm
      of all patriotic people. He began by praising Thomas Emmet. He passed from
      him to Daniel O&rsquo;Connell. He recommended everyone to read John Mitchell&rsquo;s
      &ldquo;Jail Journal.&rdquo; He described the great work done for Ireland by Charles
      Stewart Parnell. Then he said that General John Regan was, in his own way,
      at least the equal, possibly the superior, of any of the patriots he had
      named. He wound up the composition with the statement that it was
      unnecessary to recapitulate the great deeds of the General, because every
      Irishman worthy of the name knew all about them already.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one read the article with more eagerness and expectation than Gallagher
      himself. As the day of the meeting drew nearer he was becoming more and
      more uncomfortable about his speech. He had not been able to find out
      either from Doyle or from Father McCormack anything whatever about the
      General. He did not want much. He was a practised orator and could make a
      very small amount of information go a long way in a speech, but he did
      want something, if it was only a date to which he might attach the
      General&rsquo;s birth or death. Doyle and the priest steadily referred him to
      Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. From Sergeant Colgan he got nothing except a guess that the
      General might have been one of the Fenians. Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, before the
      appearance of the article, promised that it would contain all that anyone
      needed to know. After the article was published Gallagher was ashamed to
      ask for further information, because he did not want to confess himself an
      Irishman unworthy of the name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doyle also was dissatisfied and became actually restive after the
      appearance of Saturday&rsquo;s <i>Connacht Eagle</i>. He was not in the least
      troubled by the vagueness of the leading article. He was not one of the
      speakers at the meeting, and it did not matter to him whether he knew
      anything about General John Regan or not. What annoyed him was the
      publication, in the advertisement columns of the paper, of a preliminary
      list of subscribers. In the first place such an advertisement cost money
      and could only be paid for out of Mr. Billing&rsquo;s subscription, thus further
      diminishing the small balance on which he was calculating as some
      compensation for the irrecoverable debt owed to him by Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. In the
      second place his name appeared on the list as a donor, not of £5, but of
      £10. He knew perfectly well that he would not be expected to pay any
      subscription, but he was vaguely annoyed at the threat of such a
      liability.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Sunday afternoon he called on Dr. O&rsquo;Grady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it agreed,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I was to be the treasurer of the fund
      for putting up the statue?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;and you are the treasurer. Didn&rsquo;t you see
      your name printed in the <i>Connacht Eagle</i>, &lsquo;Secretary, Dr. Lucius
      O&rsquo;Grady. Treasurer, J. Doyle&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m the treasurer it&rsquo;s no more than right that I should have some say
      in the way the money&rsquo;s being spent, for let me tell you, doctor&mdash;and
      I may as well speak plain when I&rsquo;m at it&mdash;I&rsquo;m not satisfied. I&rsquo;ve had
      some correspondence with a nephew of mine who&rsquo;s in that line of business
      himself up in Dublin, and he tells me that £100 is little enough for a
      statue of any size. Now I&rsquo;m not saying that I want to close the account
      with a balance in hand&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s what you do want, Doyle, whether you say it or not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Doyle ignoring this interruption, &ldquo;it wouldn&rsquo;t suit me if
      there was any debt at the latter end. For it&rsquo;s myself would have to pay it
      if there was, and that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d not be inclined to do. The way you&rsquo;re
      spending money on posters and advertisements there&rsquo;ll be very little of
      the American gentleman&rsquo;s £100 left when it comes to buying the statue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see your point all right, Doyle, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you see it,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised at you going on the way you
      are; but, sure, I might have known that you wouldn&rsquo;t care how much you&rsquo;d
      spend or how much you&rsquo;d owe at the latter end. There&rsquo;s that £60&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t harp on about that miserable £60,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;for I won&rsquo;t
      stand it. Here I am doing the very best I can to make money for you,
      taking no end of trouble, and all you do is to come grumbling to me day
      after day about some beggarly account that I happen to owe you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s what I don&rsquo;t see is how I&rsquo;m going to make a penny out of it at all,
      the way you&rsquo;re going on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me now, Doyle. Supposing&mdash;I just say supposing&mdash;the
      Government was to build a pier, a new pier, in Ballymoy, who do you think
      would get the contract for the job?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would, of course,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;for there&rsquo;d be no other man in the town
      fit to take it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how much do you suppose you&rsquo;d make out of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of talking that way?&rdquo; said Doyle. &ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t the Government
      built us two piers already, and is it likely they&rsquo;d build us another?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the point. What I&rsquo;m asking you is: Supposing they did build
      another and you got the contract for it, how much do you suppose you&rsquo;d
      make?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;if it was a good-sized pier and if the engineer they
      sent down to inspect the work wasn&rsquo;t too smart altogether I might clear
      £100.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, suppose,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;that you were able to sell the stones
      of that old mill of yours&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re good stones, so they are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly, and you&rsquo;d expect a good price for them. Now suppose you
      succeeded in selling them to the Government as raw material for the pier&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;d be nice and handy for the work,&rdquo; said Doyle. &ldquo;Whoever was to use
      those stones for building the pier would save a devil of a lot of expense
      in carting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, of course, would be considered in fixing the price of the stones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would,&rdquo; said Doyle. &ldquo;It would have to be, for I wouldn&rsquo;t sell them
      without it was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Under those circumstances,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;what do you suppose you&rsquo;d
      make?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d make a tidy penny,&rdquo; said Doyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. Add that tidy penny to the £100 profit on the pier contract
      and it seems to me that it would pay you to lose a couple of pounds&mdash;and
      I don&rsquo;t admit that you will lose a penny&mdash;over the statue business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mention of the statue brought Doyle back from a pleasant dream to the
      region of hard fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the good of talking?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The Government will build no more
      piers here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure of that. If we were to get a hold of one of the real big
      men, say the Lord-Lieutenant, if we were to bring him down here and do him
      properly&mdash;flags, you know, Doyle, and the town band, and somebody
      with a bouquet of flowers for his wife, and somebody else&mdash;all
      respectable people, Doyle&mdash;with an illuminated address&mdash;and if
      we were all to stand round with our hats in our hands and cheer&mdash;in
      fact if we were to do all the things that those sort of fellows really
      like to see done&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We could have flags,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;and we could have the town band, and
      we could have all the rest of what you say; but what good would they be?
      The Lord-Lieutenant wouldn&rsquo;t come to Ballymoy. It&rsquo;s a backward place, so
      it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get to that in a minute,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;But just suppose now
      that we had him and did all the things I say, do you think he&rsquo;d refuse us
      a simple pier when we asked for it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know but he would. Hasn&rsquo;t the Government built two piers here
      already? Is it likely they&rsquo;d build a third?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those two piers were built years and years ago,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;One
      of them is more than ten years old this minute, and they were both built
      by the last Government The present Lord-Lieutenant has probably never so
      much as heard of them. We shouldn&rsquo;t go out of our way to remind him of
      their existence. Nobody else in Ireland will remember anything about them.
      We&rsquo;ll start talking about the new pier as if it were quite an original
      idea that nobody had ever heard of before. We&rsquo;d get it to a certainty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doyle was swept away by the glorious possibilities before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If so be the Lord-Lieutenant was to come, and the Lady-Lieutenant with
      him, and more of the lords and ladies that does be attending on them up in
      Dublin Castle&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aides-de-camp, and people of that sort,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;They&rsquo;d simply
      swarm down on us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;d have to be a luncheon for them,&rdquo; said Doyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it would be in your hotel. I forgot about the luncheon. There&rsquo;ll be a
      pot of money to be made out of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With drinks and all,&rdquo; said Doyle, with deep conviction. &ldquo;There would. The
      like of them people wouldn&rsquo;t be contented with porter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Champagne,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;is the recognised tipple for anybody high
      up in the Government service. It wouldn&rsquo;t be respectful not to offer it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he won&rsquo;t come,&rdquo; said Doyle. &ldquo;What would bring him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The statue will bring him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The statue! Talk sense, doctor. What would the like of him want to be
      looking at statues for? Won&rsquo;t he have as many as he wants in Dublin
      Castle, and better ones than we&rsquo;d be able to show him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re missing the point, Doyle. I&rsquo;m not proposing to bring him down here
      simply to look at a statue. I&rsquo;m going to ask him to unveil it. Now as far
      as I know the history of Ireland&mdash;and I&rsquo;m as well up in it as most
      men&mdash;that would be an absolutely unprecedented invitation for any
      Lord-Lieutenant to receive. The novelty of the thing will attract him at
      once. And what&rsquo;s more, the idea will appeal to his better nature. I
      needn&rsquo;t tell you, Doyle, that the earnest desire of every Lord-Lieutenant
      is to assist the material and intellectual advancement of Ireland. He&rsquo;s
      always getting opportunities of opening technical schools and industrial
      shows of one sort or another. They&rsquo;ve quite ceased to attract him. But
      we&rsquo;re displaying an entirely new spirit. By erecting a public statue in a
      town like this we are showing that we&rsquo;ve arrived at an advanced stage of
      culture. There isn&rsquo;t another potty little one-horse town in Ireland that
      has ever shown the slightest desire to set up a great and elevating work
      of art in its midst. You may not appreciate that aspect of the matter,
      Doyle, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I was to give my opinion,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d say that statues was
      foolishness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. But the Lord-Lieutenant, when he gets our invitation will give
      you credit for much finer feeling. Besides he&rsquo;ll see that we&rsquo;ve been
      studying up our past history. The name of General John Regan will mean a
      great deal to him although it conveys very little to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s what Thady Gallagher is always asking,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;who was the
      General?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gallagher ought to know,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve told him so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He does not know then. Nor I don&rsquo;t believe Father McCormack does. Nor I
      don&rsquo;t know myself. Not that it would trouble me if there never was a
      General, only that you have Mary Ellen&rsquo;s head turned with the notion that
      she&rsquo;ll be coming into a big fortune one of these days&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she not doing her work?&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Devil the tap she&rsquo;s done these two days, but what she couldn&rsquo;t help. Not
      that that bothers me, for it&rsquo;s nothing strange. She never was one for
      doing much unless you stood over her and drove her into it. But what has
      annoyed me is the way Constable Moriarty is never out of the kitchen or
      the back yard. He was after her before, but he&rsquo;s fifty times worse since
      he heard the talk about her being the niece of the General. Besides the
      notion he has that young Kerrigan wants her, which has made him wild.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Moriarty ought to have more sense,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He ought,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;but he hasn&rsquo;t. The tunes he whistles round the
      house would drive you demented if so be that you listened to them; but I
      needn&rsquo;t tell you I don&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to put up with it,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be for very
      long, and you needn&rsquo;t mind what Mary Ellen neglects so long as she attends
      properly on Mr. Billing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll attend him right enough,&rdquo; said Doyle. &ldquo;Since ever she got the
      notion that he was going to make a lady of her, attending on him is the
      one thing that she will do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you needn&rsquo;t bother your head about anything else.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      There are men in the world, a great many of them&mdash;who are capable of
      managing details with thoroughness and efficiency. These men make
      admirable lieutenants and fill subordinate positions so well that towards
      the end of their lives they are allowed to attend full dress evening
      parties with medals and stars hung round their necks or pinned on their
      coats. There are also a good many men who are capable of conceiving great
      ideas and forming vast plans, but who have an unconquerable aversion to
      anything in the way of a detail. These men generally end their days in
      obscure asylums, possibly in workhouses, and their ideas, after living for
      a while as subject matter for jests, perish unrealised. There is also a
      third kind of man, fortunately a very rare kind. He is capable of
      conceiving great ideas, and has besides an insatiable delight in working
      out details. He may end his days as a victorious general, or even as an
      emperor. If he prefers a less ostentatious kind of reward, he will die a
      millionaire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Lucius O&rsquo;Grady belonged to this third class. In the face of Doyle&rsquo;s
      objection to his expenditure on posters, he was capable of conceiving on
      the spur of the moment and without previous meditation, the audacious and
      magnificent plan of bringing the Lord-Lieutenant to Ballymoy and wrestling
      from a reluctant treasury a sufficient sum of money to build a third pier
      on the beach below the town. There may have been other men in Ireland
      capable of making such a plan. There was certainly no one else who would
      have set himself, as Dr. O&rsquo;Grady did, with tireless enthusiasm, to work
      out the details necessary to the plan&rsquo;s success.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as Doyle left him he mounted his bicycle and rode out to the
      Greggs&rsquo; home. Mr. Gregg, being the District Inspector of Police, was
      usually a very busy man. But the Government, though a hard task-master in
      the case of minor officials, does not insist on anyone inspecting or being
      inspected on Sunday afternoons. Mr. Gregg had taken advantage of the
      Government&rsquo;s respect for revealed religion, and had gone out with a
      fishing rod to catch trout. Mrs. Gregg was at home. Being a bride of not
      more than three months&rsquo; standing she had nothing particular to do, and was
      yawning rather wearily over the fashion-plates of a ladies&rsquo; paper. She
      seemed unaffectedly glad to see Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, and at once offered to give
      him tea. The doctor refused the tea, and plunged into his business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you&rsquo;ll have no objection to presenting a
      bouquet to Lady Chesterton when she comes to Ballymoy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she coming?&rdquo; said Mrs. Gregg. &ldquo;How splendid!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before marrying Mr. Gregg she had lived in a Dublin suburb. Accustomed to
      the rich and varied life of a metropolis she found Ballymoy a little dull.
      She recognised Major Kent as &ldquo;a dear old boy,&rdquo; but he was quite
      unexciting. Mrs. Ford, the wife of a rather morose stipendiary magistrate,
      had severely snubbed Mrs. Gregg. There was no one else, and the gay frocks
      of Mrs. Gregg&rsquo;s bridal outfit were wasting their first freshness with
      hardly an opportunity of being worn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s coming with the Lord-Lieutenant to unveil
      the new statue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How splendid!&rdquo; said Mrs. Gregg again. &ldquo;I heard something about the
      statue, but please tell me more, Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. I do so want to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s nothing particular to tell about the statue. It&rsquo;s to be to
      the memory of General John Regan, and will be unveiled in the usual way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This did not add much to the information which Mr. Gregg, who himself had
      gleaned what he knew from Sergeant Colgan, had already given her. But Mrs.
      Gregg was quite content with it. She did not, in fact, want to know
      anything about the statue. She only asked about it because she thought she
      ought to. Her mind was dwelling on the dazzling prospect of presenting a
      bouquet to Lady Chesterton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I should love to,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But I wonder if I could&mdash;really,
      I mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. O&rsquo;Grady was a man of quick intelligence. He realised at once that Mrs.
      Gregg had not been listening to his account of the statue, but that she
      was replying to his original suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the least difficult,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Anyone could do it, but we&rsquo;d
      like to have it done really well. That&rsquo;s the reason we&rsquo;re asking you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you have to walk backwards?&rdquo; said Mrs. Gregg. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to do it,
      of course, but I never have before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no necessity to walk at all. You simply stand in the front row of
      the spectators with the bouquet in your hand. Then, when she stops
      opposite you and smiles&mdash;she&rsquo;ll be warned beforehand, of course&mdash;and
      she&rsquo;s had such a lot of practice that she&rsquo;s sure to do it right&mdash;you
      curtsey and hand up the bouquet. She&rsquo;ll take it, and the whole thing will
      be over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gregg, &ldquo;is that all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. O&rsquo;Grady was conscious of a note of disappointment in her voice. He
      felt that he had over-emphasized the simplicity of the performance. Mrs.
      Gregg would have preferred a longer ceremony. He did his best to make such
      amends as were still possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;your photograph will be in all the illustrated
      papers afterwards, and there will be a long description of your dress in
      <i>The Irish Times</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to do it,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gregg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll consider that settled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leaving Mrs. Gregg, he rode on to Major Kent&rsquo;s house. The Major, like all
      men who are over forty years of age, who have good consciences and
      balances in their banks, spent his Sunday afternoons sleeping in an
      armchair. No one likes being awakened, either in a bedroom by a servant,
      in a railway carriage by a ticket collector, or on a Sunday afternoon by a
      friend. The Major answered Dr. O&rsquo;Grady&rsquo;s greeting snappishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve come,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to ask me to make a speech at that meeting of
      yours on Tuesday, you may go straight home again, for I won&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not such a fool,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady pleasantly, &ldquo;as to ask you to do
      any such thing. I know jolly well you couldn&rsquo;t. Even if you could and
      would, we shouldn&rsquo;t want you. We have Father McCormack, and Thady
      Gallagher, besides the American. That&rsquo;s as much as any audience could
      stand!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it isn&rsquo;t that you want,&rdquo; said the Major, &ldquo;what is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity you&rsquo;re in such an uncommonly bad temper, Major. If you were
      even in your normal condition of torpid sulkiness you&rsquo;d be rather pleased
      to hear what I&rsquo;m going to tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to tell me that you&rsquo;ve dropped that statue folly, I shall
      be extremely pleased.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The news I have,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;is far better than that. We&rsquo;ve
      decided to ask the Lord-Lieutenant down to unveil the statue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t come,&rdquo; said the Major, &ldquo;so that&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will come when it&rsquo;s explained to him that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, if you offer him one of your explanations&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Major. I don&rsquo;t think you quite grasp the significance of what
      I&rsquo;m telling you. Ever since I&rsquo;ve known you you&rsquo;ve been deploring the
      disloyalty of the Irish people. I don&rsquo;t blame you for that. You&rsquo;re by way
      of being a Unionist, so of course you have to. But if you were the least
      bit sincere in what you say, you&rsquo;d be delighted to hear that Doyle and
      Thady Gallagher&mdash;Thady hasn&rsquo;t actually been told yet, but when he is
      he&rsquo;ll be as pleased as everyone else&mdash;you ought to be simply
      overjoyed to find that men like Doyle are inviting the Lord-Lieutenant
      down to unveil their statue. It shows that they&rsquo;re getting steadily
      loyaler and loyaler. Instead of exulting in the fact you start sneering in
      a cynical and altogether disgusting way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe much in Doyle&rsquo;s loyalty,&rdquo; said the Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fortunately,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;Doyle thoroughly believes in yours. He
      agrees with me that you are the first man who ought to be asked to join
      the reception committee. You can&rsquo;t possibly refuse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would refuse if I thought there was the slightest chance of the
      Lord-Lieutenant coming. Do you think I want to stand about in a tall hat
      along with half the blackguards in town?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Gregg is going to present a bouquet,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looking like a fool in the middle of the street, while you play silly
      tricks with a statue?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be asked to do all that,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am being asked. You&rsquo;re asking me this minute, and if I thought it would
      come off&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you think it won&rsquo;t you may as well join the committee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be secretary,&rdquo; said the Major, &ldquo;and I won&rsquo;t have hand, act, or
      part, in asking the Lord-Lieutenant to come here. We don&rsquo;t want him, for
      one thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll not be asked so much as to sign a paper,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;If
      your name is required at the bottom of any document I&rsquo;ll write it for you
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to goodness,&rdquo; said the Major, &ldquo;that Billing&mdash;if that&rsquo;s the
      man&rsquo;s name&mdash;had stayed in America attending to his own business,
      whatever it is, instead of coming here and starting all this fuss.
      There&rsquo;ll be trouble before you&rsquo;ve done, O&rsquo;Grady, more trouble than you
      care for. I wish to God it was all well over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nothing is more gratifying to the prophet of evil than the fulfilment of
      his own prediction. When the fulfilment follows hard on the prophecy, when
      not more than half an hour separates them, the prophet ought to be a very
      happy man. This was Major Kent&rsquo;s case. He foretold trouble of the most
      exasperating kind for Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, and he was immediately justified by the
      event. Unfortunately he did not expect an immediate fulfilment of his
      words. Therefore he turned round in his chair and went to sleep again when
      the doctor left him. If he had been sanguine enough to expect that the
      doctor would be entangled in embarrassments at once, he would probably
      have roused himself. He would have followed Dr. O&rsquo;Grady back to Ballymoy
      and would have had the satisfaction of gloating over the first of a long
      series of annoying difficulties. But the Major, though confident that
      trouble would come, had no hope that it would begin as soon as it did.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. O&rsquo;Grady was riding back to Ballymoy on his bicycle when he met Mrs.
      Ford, the wife of the stipendiary magistrate. She was walking briskly
      along the road which led out of the town. This fact at once aroused a
      feeling of vague uneasiness in the doctor&rsquo;s mind. Mrs. Ford was a stout
      lady of more than fifty years of age. She always wore clothes which
      seemed, and probably were, much too tight for her. Her husband&rsquo;s position
      and income entitled him to keep a pony trap, therefore Mrs. Ford very
      seldom walked at all. Dr. O&rsquo;Grady had never before seen her walk quickly.
      It was plain, too, that on this occasion Mrs. Ford was walking for the
      mere sake of walking, a most unnatural thing for her to do. The road she
      was on led nowhere except to Major Kent&rsquo;s house, several miles away, and
      it was quite impossible to suppose that she meant to call on him. She had,
      as Dr. O&rsquo;Grady knew, quarrelled seriously with Major Kent two days
      earlier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, slightly anxious and very curious, got off his bicycle and
      approached Mrs. Ford on foot. He noticed at once that her face was purple
      in colour. It was generally red, and the unaccustomed exercise she was
      taking might account for the darker shade. Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, arriving within a
      few yards of her, took off his hat very politely. The purple of Mrs.
      Ford&rsquo;s face darkened ominously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nice day,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s Mr. Ford?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ford acknowledged this greeting with a stiff, scarcely perceptible
      bow. Dr. O&rsquo;Grady realised at once that she was angry, very seriously angry
      about something. Under ordinary circumstances Mrs. Ford&rsquo;s anger would not
      have caused Dr. O&rsquo;Grady any uneasiness. She was nearly always angry with
      someone, and however angry she might be she would be obliged to call on
      Dr. O&rsquo;Grady for assistance if either she or her husband fell ill. There
      was no other doctor in the neighbourhood. The simplest and easiest thing,
      under the circumstances, would have been to pass on without comment, and
      to wait patiently until Mrs. Ford either caught influenza or was so deeply
      offended with someone else as to forget her anger against him. Society in
      small country towns is held together very largely by the fact that it is
      highly inconvenient, if not actually impossible, to keep two quarrels
      burning briskly at the same time. When, a week or two before, Mrs. Ford
      had been seriously angry with Mrs. Gregg, she confided her grievances to
      Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. Now that she was annoyed with him she would be compelled to
      condone Mrs. Gregg&rsquo;s offence in order to tell her what Dr. O&rsquo;Grady had
      done. In due time, so Dr. O&rsquo;Grady knew, he would be forgiven in order that
      he might listen to the story of the quarrel, which by that time she would
      have picked with Major Kent. Therefore the doctor&rsquo;s first impulse was to
      imitate the Levite in the parable, and, having looked at Mrs. Ford with
      sympathy, to pass by on the other side.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Dr. O&rsquo;Grady was engaged in a great enterprise. He did not see how Mrs.
      Ford&rsquo;s anger could make or mar the success of the Lord-Lieutenant&rsquo;s visit
      to Ballymoy, but he could not afford to take risks. No wise general likes
      to leave even a small wood on the flank of his line of march without
      discovering whether there is anything in it or not. Dr. O&rsquo;Grady determined
      to find out, if he could, what Mrs. Ford was sulking about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daresay you have heard,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;about the Lord-Lieutenant&rsquo;s visit to
      Ballymoy. The date isn&rsquo;t fixed yet, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ford sniffed and walked on without speaking. Dr. O&rsquo;Grady was not the
      kind of man who is easily baffled. He turned round and walked beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I needn&rsquo;t tell you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that the visit may mean a good deal to Mr.
      Ford. We&rsquo;ve all felt for a long time that his services and ability entitle
      him to some recognition from the Government.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ford was quite unmollified. She walked on without looking round. She
      even walked a little quicker than she had been walking before. This was a
      foolish thing to do. She was a fat and elderly lady. Some of her clothes,
      if not all of them, were certainly too tight for her. The doctor was young
      and in good condition. She could not possibly hope to outstrip him in a
      race.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My idea is,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;that when the Lord-Lieutenant meets Mr.
      Ford and becomes personally acquainted with him&mdash;there&rsquo;s to be a
      lunch, you know, in the hotel. A pretty good lunch, the best Doyle can do.
      Well, I confidently expect that when the Lord-Lieutenant finds out for
      himself what an able and energetic man Mr. Ford is&mdash;&mdash; After
      all, there are much nicer places than Ballymoy, besides all the jobs there
      are going under the Insurance Act, jolly well paid some of them, and you&rsquo;d
      like living in Dublin, wouldn&rsquo;t you, Mrs. Ford?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ford stood still suddenly. She was evidently going to say something.
      Dr. O&rsquo;Grady waited. He had to wait for some time, because the lady was
      very-much out of breath. At last she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. O&rsquo;Grady,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I believe in plain speaking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Neither Dr. O&rsquo;Grady nor anyone else in Ballymoy doubted the truth of this.
      Nearly everybody had been spoken to plainly by Mrs. Ford at one time or
      another. Kerrigan, the butcher, was spoken to with uncompromising
      plainness once a week, on Saturday mornings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s nothing like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I may as well tell you,&rdquo; said Mrs. Ford, &ldquo;that I think it was due to
      my position&mdash;however much you may dislike me personally&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t. On the contrary&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;Due to my position as the wife of the resident magistrate
      that I, and not that Mrs. Gregg, should have been invited to present the
      bouquet to Lady Chesterton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. O&rsquo;Grady gasped. Then he realised that he had made a fearful blunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Half an hour ago,&rdquo; said Mrs. Ford, &ldquo;that woman, who isn&rsquo;t even a lady,
      bounced into my house, giggling, and told me to my face that you had asked
      her&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silly little thing, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;But of course, you
      have far too much sense to be annoyed by anything she said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t imagine for a moment,&rdquo; said Mrs. Ford, &ldquo;that I am vexed. The
      slight, although it was evidently intentional, does not affect me in the
      least. If you knew me a little better than you do, Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, you would
      understand that I am not at all the sort of person who cares about
      presenting bouquets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;We quite realised that. We understood
      that in your position, as wife of the resident magistrate of the district,
      the presentation of a bouquet would have been <i>infra dig</i>. After all,
      what&rsquo;s a bouquet? Poor little Mrs. Gregg! Of course it&rsquo;s a great promotion
      for her and she&rsquo;s naturally a bit above herself. But no one would dream of
      asking you to present a bouquet. We have far too high a respect for Mr.
      Ford&rsquo;s position.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Mrs. Ford, &ldquo;that I ought to have been consulted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you get my letter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got no letter whatever. The first news I had of his Excellency&rsquo;s
      intention of visiting Ballymoy came to me from that Mrs. Gregg half an
      hour ago, when she rushed into my drawing-room with her hair tumbling
      about her ears&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the worst of Doyle. He means well, but he&rsquo;s frightfully careless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has Mr. Doyle to do with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I gave him the letter to post. Did you really not get it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got no letter whatever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you must have thought of us. I don&rsquo;t know what Mr. Ford
      must have thought. I don&rsquo;t know how to apologise. But the first thing we
      did, the very first&mdash;&mdash;Mrs. Gregg and the bouquet were a mere
      afterthought, we just tacked her on to the programme so that the poor
      little woman wouldn&rsquo;t feel out of it. She is a silly little thing, you
      know. Not more than a child after all. It was better to humour her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was in the letter which you say you posted?&rdquo; said Mrs. Ford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say I posted it. I said Doyle forgot to. It&rsquo;s in his pocket at
      this moment, I expect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was in it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you ask? There is only one thing which could possibly be in it. It
      expresses the unanimous wish of the committee&mdash;the reception
      committee, you know&mdash;Major Kent&rsquo;s on it&mdash;that you should present
      an illuminated address of welcome to His Excellency.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If such a letter were really written&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Mrs. Ford! But I don&rsquo;t ask you to take my word for it. Just walk
      straight into Ballymoy yourself. I&rsquo;ll stay here till you come back. Go
      into the hotel. You&rsquo;ll find Doyle in his own room drinking whisky and
      water with Thady Gallagher. Don&rsquo;t say a word to him. Don&rsquo;t ask him whether
      he was given a letter or not. Simply put your hand into his breast pocket
      and take it out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Mrs. Ford. &ldquo;I do not care to have anything to do with
      Mr. Doyle when he is drunk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t be. Not at this hour. It takes a lot to make Doyle drunk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When the letter arrives, if it ever does, I shall consult Mr. Ford as to
      what answer I shall give.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can tell you what he&rsquo;ll say beforehand,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll
      realise the importance of the illuminated address. He&rsquo;ll understand that
      it&rsquo;s <i> the</i> thing and that the bouquet&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, Dr. O&rsquo;Grady,&rdquo; said Mrs. Ford.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor mounted his bicycle. His face was very nearly as purple as Mrs.
      Ford&rsquo;s. He had, with the greatest difficulty survived a crisis. He rode at
      top speed into Ballymoy, and dismounted, very hot, at the door of the
      hotel. It was shut. He ran round to the back of the house and entered the
      yard. Constable Moriarty and Mary Ellen were sitting side by side on the
      wall of the pig-stye. They were sitting very close together. Moriarty was
      whistling &ldquo;Eileen Allan-nah&rdquo; softly in Mary Ellen&rsquo;s ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Mr. Doyle?&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As regards the visit of the Lord-Lieutenant,&rdquo; said Constable Moriarty
      rousing himself and moving a little bit away from Mary Ellen, &ldquo;what I was
      saying this minute to Mary Ellen was&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Mr. Doyle?&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s within,&rdquo; said Mary Ellen. &ldquo;Where else would he be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As regards the Lord-Lieutenant,&rdquo; said Constable Moriarty, &ldquo;and seeing
      that Mary Ellen might be a near friend of the gentleman that the statue&rsquo;s
      for&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. O&rsquo;Grady hurried through the back door. He found Doyle sitting over
      account books in his private-room. That was his way of spending Sunday
      afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sheet of notepaper,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;Quick now, Doyle. I have my
      fountain pen, so don&rsquo;t bother about ink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the hurry?&rdquo; said Doyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s every hurry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wrote rapidly, folded the letter, addressed it to Mrs. Ford, and handed
      it to Doyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put that in your trousers&rsquo; pocket,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and roll it round a few
      times. I want it to look as if it had been there for two or three days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the meaning of this at all?&rdquo; said Doyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now get your hat. Go off as fast as you can pelt to Mr. Ford&rsquo;s house.
      Give that letter to the servant and tell her that you only found out this
      afternoon that you&rsquo;d forgotten to post it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you tell me&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you nothing till you&rsquo;re back. Go on now, Doyle. Go at once. If
      you hurry you&rsquo;ll get to the house before she does. She was two miles out
      of the town when I left her and too exhausted to walk fast. But if you do
      meet her remember that you haven&rsquo;t seen me since yesterday. Have you got
      that clear in your head? Very well. Off with you. And, I say, I expect the
      letter will be looking all right when you take it out again, but if it
      isn&rsquo;t just rub it up and down the front of your trousers for a while. I
      want it to be brownish and a good deal crumpled. It won&rsquo;t do any harm if
      you blow a few puffs of tobacco over it.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
    <p>
      An hour later Doyle entered the doctor&rsquo;s consulting room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have it done,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I done what you bid me; but devil such a job
      ever I had as what it was.&rdquo; Doyle had evidently suffered from some strong
      emotion, anger perhaps, or terror. He felt in his pocket as he spoke, and,
      finding that he had no handkerchief, he wiped his forehead with the back
      of his hand. He looked at his hand afterwards and sighed. The hairs on the
      back of it were pasted down with sweat &ldquo;Have you such a thing as a drop of
      anything to drink in the house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;how could I? Do you think I&rsquo;ve lost all
      my self-respect? Is it likely I&rsquo;d order another bottle of whisky out of
      your shop when you&rsquo;re dunning me every day of my life for the price of the
      last I got? Tell me what happened about the letter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doyle passed a parched tongue across his lips. The inside of his mouth was
      quite dry. Extreme nervous excitement often produces this effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it was even a cup of tea,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it would be better than nothing.
      I&rsquo;ve a terrible thirst on me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve no tea either. Not a grain in the
      house since last Friday. I hope this will be a lesson to you, Doyle, and
      will teach you not to ballyrag your customers in future. But I don&rsquo;t want
      to rub it in. Get on with your story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It could be,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;that there&rsquo;d be water in your pump. I&rsquo;m not
      sure will I be able to speak much without I drink something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pump&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;Just sit where you are for a
      moment and I&rsquo;ll fetch you some water. It may give you typhoid. I wouldn&rsquo;t
      drink it myself without boiling it, but that&rsquo;s your look out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He left the moor and returned a few minutes later with a large tumbler of
      cold water. Doyle looked at it mournfully. He knew perfectly well that the
      doctor had both whisky and tea in the house, but he recognised the
      impossibility of getting either the one or the other. He raised the glass
      to his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glory be to God,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve wetted my lips
      with the same this twenty years!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will do you a lot of good if it doesn&rsquo;t give you typhoid,&rdquo; said Dr.
      O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;How did you get so frightfully thirsty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The question was natural. Doyle drank the whole tumbler of water at a
      draught. There was no doubt that he had been very thirsty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you tell me now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what had that one in the temper she was
      in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Ford,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;was annoyed because she thought she wasn&rsquo;t
      going to be given a chance of making herself agreeable to the
      Lord-Lieutenant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she speaks to the Lord-Lieutenant,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;after the fashion she
      was speaking to me, it&rsquo;s likely that she&rsquo;ll not get the chance of making
      herself agreeable to him a second time. Devil such a temper I ever saw any
      woman in, and I&rsquo;ve seen some in my day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know she&rsquo;d be a bit savage. I hoped you wouldn&rsquo;t have met her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did meet her. Wasn&rsquo;t she turning in at the gate at the same time that I
      was myself? &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a letter here, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;that the doctor told
      me I was to give to you,&rsquo; &lsquo;I suppose it was half an hour ago,&rsquo; said she,
      &lsquo;that he told you that,&rsquo; Well, I pulled the letter out of my pocket, and I
      gave it a rub along the side of my pants the same as you told me. &lsquo;I
      suppose you&rsquo;re doing that,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;to put some dirt on it, to make it
      look,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;as if it had been in your pocket a week.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t think to look at her that she was so cute,&rdquo; said Dr.
      O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said nothing either good or bad,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;only that it was to get
      the dirt off the letter, and not to be putting it on that I was giving it
      a bit of a rub. Well, she took the letter and she opened it. Then she
      looked me straight in the face. &lsquo;When did you get this letter from the
      doctor?&rsquo; says she. So I told her it was last Friday you give it to me, and
      that I hadn&rsquo;t seen you since, and didn&rsquo;t care a great deal if I never seen
      you again. &lsquo;You impudent blackguard,&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;the letter&rsquo;s not an hour
      written. The ink&rsquo;s not more than just dry on it yet,&rsquo; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m surprised,&rsquo; 
      said I, &lsquo;that it&rsquo;s that much itself. It&rsquo;s dripping wet I&rsquo;d expect it to be
      with the sweat I&rsquo;m in this minute on account of the way I&rsquo;ve run to give
      it to you.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;If there was a drop of whisky in the house I&rsquo;d
      give it to you. I&rsquo;ll look in a minute. There might be some left in the
      bottom of the bottle. A man who can tell a lie like that on the spur of
      the moment&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was true enough about the sweat,&rdquo; said Doyle. &ldquo;You could have wrung my
      shirt into a bucket, though it wasn&rsquo;t running did it, for I didn&rsquo;t run. It
      was the way she was looking at me. I&rsquo;m not overly fond of Mr. Ford, and
      never was; but I don&rsquo;t know did ever I feel as sorry for any man as I did
      for him when she was looking at me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor rose and took a bottle of whisky from the cupboard in the
      corner of the room. There was enough in it to give Doyle a satisfactory
      drink and still to leave some for the doctor himself. He got another
      tumbler and two bottles of soda water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t be opening one of them for me,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;I have as much
      water drunk already as would drown all the whisky you have in the bottle.
      What I take now I&rsquo;ll take plain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She may be a bit sceptical about the letter,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;but I
      expect when she&rsquo;s talked it over with Ford she&rsquo;ll see the sense of
      presenting the illuminated address.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it that one present the address? Believe you me, doctor, if she does
      the Lord-Lieutenant won&rsquo;t be inclined for giving us the pier. The look of
      her would turn a barrel of porter sour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll look quite different,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;when the time comes.
      After all, Ford has to make the best of his opportunities like the rest of
      us. He can&rsquo;t afford to allow his wife to scowl at the Lord-Lieutenant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was there no one else about the place, only her?&rdquo; said Doyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There were others, of course; but&mdash;the fact is, Doyle, if we got her
      back up at the start her husband would have written letters to Dublin
      Castle crabbing the whole show. Those fellows up there place extraordinary
      confidence in resident magistrates. They&rsquo;d have been much more inclined to
      believe him than either you or me. If Ford was to set to work to spoil our
      show we&rsquo;d probably not have got the Lord-Lieutenant down here at all.
      That&rsquo;s why I was so keen on your getting the letter to her at once, and
      leaving her under the impression that you&rsquo;d had it in your pocket for two
      days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Devil the sign of believing any such thing there was about her when I
      left.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She may come to believe it later on,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;when she and
      Ford have had time to talk the whole thing over together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor&rsquo;s servant came into the room while he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Constable Moriarty is outside at the door,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and he&rsquo;s wishing
      to speak with you. There&rsquo;s a young woman along with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary Ellen, I expect,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s upset in his mind about that same Mary Ellen,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;ever
      since he heard she was the niece of the General. It&rsquo;s day and night he&rsquo;s
      round the hotel whistling all sorts and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You told me all about that before,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;Bring him in,
      Bridgy, bring in the pair of them, and let&rsquo;s hear what it is they want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Constable Moriarty entered the room, followed at a little distance by Mary
      Ellen. He led her forward, and set her in front of Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. He looked
      very much as Touchstone must have looked when he presented the rustic
      Audrey to the exiled Duke as &ldquo;a poor virgin, sir, an ill-favoured thing,
      sir, but mine own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you want a marriage license,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve come to the
      wrong man. Go up to Father McCormack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not want a marriage license,&rdquo; said Constable Moriarty, &ldquo;for I&rsquo;m not
      long enough in the force to get leave to marry. And to do it without leave
      is what I wouldn&rsquo;t care to risk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t want to marry her,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be glad if you&rsquo;d let
      her alone the way she&rsquo;d be able to do her work. It&rsquo;s upsetting her mind
      you are with the way you&rsquo;re going on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it true what they tell me,&rdquo; said Moriarty, &ldquo;that the Lord-Lieutenant&rsquo;s
      coming to the town?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we may say it is true,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To open the statue you&rsquo;re putting up to the General?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Open&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t the word used about statues,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;but you&rsquo;ve
      got the general idea right enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I was saying to Mary Ellen,&rdquo; said Moriarty, &ldquo;is that seeing as she&rsquo;s
      the niece of the General&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s no such thing,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;and well you know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The doctor has it put out about her that she is,&rdquo; said Moriarty, &ldquo;and
      Mary Ellen&rsquo;s well enough content. Aren&rsquo;t you, Mary Ellen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am surely,&rdquo; said Mary Ellen. &ldquo;Why wouldn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Moriarty,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ve got any idea into your
      head that there&rsquo;s a fortune either large or small coming to Mary Ellen out
      of this business you&rsquo;re making a big mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t thinking any such thing,&rdquo; said Moriarty. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I know well
      enough it&rsquo;s only talk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be as much as we can possibly do,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;to pay for
      the statue and the incidental expenses. Pensioning off Mary Ellen
      afterwards is simply out of the question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let alone that she doesn&rsquo;t deserve a pension,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;and wouldn&rsquo;t
      get one if we were wading up to our knees in sovereigns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you may put it out of your head that Mary Ellen will make a penny by
      it,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t that I was thinking of at all,&rdquo; said Moriarty, &ldquo;for I know you
      couldn&rsquo;t do it. My notion&mdash;what I was saying to Mary Ellen a minute
      ago&mdash;is that if the Lord-Lieutenant was to be told&mdash;at the time
      that he&rsquo;d be looking at the statue&mdash;whenever that might be&mdash;that
      Mary Ellen was the niece of the General&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re planning out a regular court presentation for Mary Ellen,&rdquo; said
      Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;the thing can&rsquo;t be done. No one here is in a position to
      present anyone else because we have none of us been presented ourselves.
      Besides, it wouldn&rsquo;t be the least use to her if she was presented. The
      Lord-Lieutenant wouldn&rsquo;t take her on as an upper housemaid or anything of
      that sort merely because she&rsquo;d been presented to him as General John
      Regan&rsquo;s niece.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t a situation for Mary Ellen I was thinking of,&rdquo; said Moriarty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the name of God,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;will you tell us what it is you have in
      your mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I was thinking,&rdquo; said Moriarty, &ldquo;was that if the matter was
      represented to the Lord-Lieutenant in a proper manner&mdash;-about Mary
      Ellen being the General&rsquo;s niece and all to that&mdash;he might, maybe, see
      his way to making me a sergeant. It was that I was saying to you, Mary
      Ellen, wasn&rsquo;t it, now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was,&rdquo; said Mary Ellen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The idea of trotting out Mary Ellen on the occasion isn&rsquo;t at all a bad
      one,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see what can be done about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m obliged to you,&rdquo; said Moriarty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t promise that you&rsquo;ll be made a sergeant, mind that now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure I know you couldn&rsquo;t promise that,&rdquo; said Moriarty. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll do the
      best you can. Come along now, Mary Ellen. It&rsquo;s pretty near time for me to
      be going on patrol, and the sergeant will check me if I&rsquo;m late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something in that idea of Moriarty&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, when he
      and Doyle were alone again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what good will come of it,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m doubting
      whether Thady Gallagher will be pleased. Mary Ellen&rsquo;s mother was a cousin
      of his own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a good-looking girl,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;If we had her cleaned up a
      bit and a nice dress put on her she&rsquo;d look rather well standing at the
      foot of the statue. I expect the Lord-Lieutenant would be pleased to see
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who&rsquo;d be getting the lunch for the Lord-Lieutenant,&rdquo; said Doyle,
      &ldquo;when Mary Ellen would be playing herself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get someone to manage the lunch all right. The great thing for us
      is to be sure of making a good general impression on the Lord-Lieutenant,
      and I think Mary Ellen would help. I daresay you&rsquo;ve never noticed it,
      Doyle&mdash;it would be hard for you when she will not wash her face&mdash;but
      she really is a good-looking girl. The Lord-Lieutenant will want something
      of the sort to look at after he&rsquo;s faced Mrs. Ford and her illuminated
      address. She&rsquo;s not exactly&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man that would run away with that one,&rdquo; said Doyle vindictively,
      &ldquo;would do it in the dark if he did it at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;we ought to think of poor little Mary Ellen
      herself. It&rsquo;ll be a great day for her, and she&rsquo;ll enjoy having a new
      dress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s to pay for the dress?&rdquo; said Doyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dress will be paid for out of the general funds. I&rsquo;ll ask Mrs. Gregg
      to see about having it made. She has remarkably good taste. I&rsquo;ll tell her
      not to get anything very expensive, so you need not worry about that. And
      now, Doyle, unless there&rsquo;s anything else you want to settle with me at
      once, I think I&rsquo;ll write our invitation to the Lord-Lieutenant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be well if you did,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;so as we&rsquo;d know whether he&rsquo;s
      coming or not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;ll come. If he boggles at it at all I&rsquo;ll go up to Dublin and see
      him myself. A short verbal explanation&mdash;&mdash; We&rsquo;ll let him choose
      his own date.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doyle lit his pipe and walked back to the hotel. He found Thady Gallagher
      waiting for him in his private room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this I&rsquo;m after hearing,&rdquo; said Gallagher, &ldquo;about the
      Lord-Lieutenant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming down here,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;to open the new statue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke firmly, for he detected a note of displeasure in the tone in
      which Thady Gallagher asked this question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Gallagher, &ldquo;would I be altogether in favour of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why not? Mustn&rsquo;t there be someone to open it? And mightn&rsquo;t it as well
      be him as another?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might not as well be him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak out, Thady, what have you against the man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a good Nationalist,&rdquo; said Gallagher, &ldquo;and I always was, and my father
      before me was the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m that myself,&rdquo; said Doyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m opposed to flunkeyism, whether it&rsquo;s the flunkeyism of the rent
      office or&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well and if you are, isn&rsquo;t it the same with all of us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I say is this,&rdquo; said Gallagher, &ldquo;as long as the people of Ireland is
      denied the inalienable right of managing their own affairs I&rsquo;d be opposed
      to welcoming into our midst the emissaries of Dublin Castle, and I&rsquo;d like
      to know, so I would, what the people of this locality will be saying to
      the man that&rsquo;s false to his principles and goes back on the dearest
      aspirations of our hearts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He glared quite fiercely while he spoke, but Doyle remained serenely
      unimpressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talk sense now, Thady,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Nobody&rsquo;ll say a word without it&rsquo;d be
      yourself and you making a speech at the time. It&rsquo;s for the good of the
      town that we&rsquo;re getting him down here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What good?&rdquo; said Gallagher, &ldquo;tell me that now. What good will come of the
      like?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doyle was unwilling to confide the whole pier scheme to Gallagher. He
      contented himself with a vague reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s many a thing,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that would be for the good of the town
      that might be got if it was represented properly to the Lord-Lieutenant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I thought that,&rdquo; said Gallagher, &ldquo;I might&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was in a difficult position. He did not want to quarrel with Doyle, who
      provided him with a good deal of bottled porter, but he did not want to
      identify himself with a public welcome to the Lord-Lieutenant, because he
      had hopes of becoming a Member of Parliament. The idea of conferring a
      benefit on the town attracted him as offering a way out of his difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he repeated slowly. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say but
      it&rsquo;s possible that I might.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you will,&rdquo; said Doyle soothingly, &ldquo;you will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not be a party to any address of welcome from the Urban District
      Council,&rdquo; said Gallagher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We wouldn&rsquo;t ask it of you. Doesn&rsquo;t everybody know that you wouldn&rsquo;t
      consent to it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Major put you up to it,&rdquo; said Gallagher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was not then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it wasn&rsquo;t him it was Mr. Ford, the R.M.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;d seen Mrs. Ford when she heard of it,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;you wouldn&rsquo;t
      be saying that. Tell me this now, Thady. Have you your speech ready for
      the meeting on Tuesday? Everybody&rsquo;s saying you&rsquo;ll be making a grand one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t it what you&rsquo;d call rightly ready,&rdquo; said Gallagher, &ldquo;but I have
      it so as it will be ready when the time comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s you the people will be wanting to hear,&rdquo; said Doyle. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s you
      they&rsquo;d rather be listening to than any other one even if he was a member
      of Parliament: It&rsquo;s my opinion, Thady, and there&rsquo;s more than me that says
      it&mdash;it&rsquo;s my opinion there&rsquo;s better men that isn&rsquo;t in Parliament than
      some that is. I&rsquo;ll say no more presently; but some day I&rsquo;ll be doing more
      than say it.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <p>
      The public meeting was a very great success, in spite of the absence of
      the Members of Parliament, who certainly gave poor value for their
      salaries. The town band, headed by young Kerrigan, who played the cornet,
      paraded the streets for half-an-hour before the meeting. It played &ldquo;The
      Bonnie, Bonnie Banks of Loch Lomond&rdquo; three times over, &ldquo;The Boys of
      Wexford&rdquo; twice, and &ldquo;God Save Ireland&rdquo; four times. This served to remind
      the people that something of an interesting and patriotic kind was going
      to happen. A band is much more effective in attracting public attention
      than a town crier, and it ought, one may suppose, to arrange a kind of
      code of tunes by means of which people would be able to tell at once
      without verbal inquiry what sort of event was intended. For an auction of
      household furniture, for instance, a thing which takes place when a family
      leaves the locality, the band might play &ldquo;The Harp that Once Through
      Tara&rsquo;s Halls.&rdquo; Everybody would recognise the appropriateness of the words
      about the banquet hall deserted, and the departure of the people who had
      used it. For the other kind of auction, that at which the cows of men who
      refuse to pay their rents are sold, &ldquo;God Save Ireland,&rdquo; would be suitable,
      and anyone who heard it would know that though he might attend the auction
      he had better not bid. An ingenious musician would have no difficulty in
      finding tunes which would suggest the presentation of illuminated
      addresses to curates or bank managers. Meetings convened for the purpose
      of expressing confidence in the Members of Parliament, of either the
      Nationalist or the Unionist parties, would naturally be announced by a
      performance of Handel&rsquo;s fine song &ldquo;Angels ever Bright and Fair.&rdquo; There
      might be a difficulty about unusual events like the erection of statues,
      but a tune might be kept for them which would at all events warn people
      not to expect an auction, a presentation or a political meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearly half the people who were doing business in the fair assembled at
      three o&rsquo;clock in the square outside Doyle&rsquo;s hotel. According to the
      estimate printed afterwards in the <i>Connacht Eagle</i> there were more
      than two thousand persons present. Of these at least twenty listened to
      all the speeches that were made. The number of those who heard parts of
      some of the speeches was much larger, amounting probably to sixty, for
      there was a good deal of coming and going, of moving in and out of the
      group round the speakers. The rest of the audience stood about in various
      parts of the square. Men talked to each other on the interesting questions
      of the price of cattle and the prospects of a change in the weather. Women
      stood together with parcels in their hands and looked at each other
      without talking at all. But everyone was so far interested in the speeches
      as to join in the cheers when anything which ought to be cheered was said.
      The twenty stalwart listeners who stood out all the speeches attended to
      what was said and started the cheers at the proper moments. The stragglers
      who, hearing only a sentence or two now and then, were liable to miss
      points, took up the cheers which were started. The mass of the men, those
      who were talking about cattle, very courteously stopped their
      conversations and joined in whenever they heard a cheer beginning. There
      was, so Gallagher said in the next issue of the <i>Connacht Eagle</i>, an
      unmistakable and most impressive popular enthusiasm for General John
      Regan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father McCormack, standing on a chair borrowed from Doyle&rsquo;s Hotel, opened
      the proceedings. He said that Ireland had always been famed for its
      hospitality to strangers and its courtesy to women. He hoped that it
      always would be. Looking round on the faces of the men gathered in front
      of him, he felt quite certain that it always would be. Mr. Billing, who
      was to address the meeting that day, was a stranger, a very distinguished
      stranger, one whose name was a household word wherever the deeds of
      General John Regan were remembered, one whose name would be still better
      known when his forthcoming life of the General appeared. He was proud and
      pleased to extend to Mr. Billing on behalf of the audience a hearty <i>Caed
      Mille Failthe</i>. He hoped that Mr. Billing would carry back with him a
      pleasant recollection of Irish hospitality when he returned to&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Father McCormack hesitated and looked round. Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, who was
      standing behind him whispered the word &ldquo;Bolivia.&rdquo; Father McCormack
      repeated the word &ldquo;Bolivia&rdquo; aloud and everybody cheered. Father McCormack
      moistened his lips and went on to say that Mr. Billing was not a woman,
      but Irish courtesy, though always extended to women, was not confined to
      women. In the name of the audience he promised Mr. Billing some Irish
      courtesy.
    </p>
    <p>
      A further reference to Mr. Billing&rsquo;s literary work gave Father McCormack
      an opportunity of warning his audience against Sunday newspapers published
      in England, which, he said, reeked of the gutter and were horribly
      subversive of faith and morals. Ireland, he added, had newspapers of her
      own which no one need be ashamed or afraid to read. As an evidence of the
      confidence he felt in the elevating character of Irish newspapers he
      called upon Mr. Thaddeus Gallagher, the distinguished editor of the <i>Connacht
      Eagle</i>, to address the meeting. Then with the assistance of Dr.
      O&rsquo;Grady, he stepped off the chair. Having reached the ground safely he sat
      down on the chair. He had a perfect right to do this because he was
      chairman of the meeting; but a slight delay followed. Another chair had to
      be brought from the hotel for Gallagher to stand on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gallagher&rsquo;s speech was an eloquent paraphrase of the leading article which
      Dr. O&rsquo;Grady had written for him the previous week. Once or twice he broke
      away from his original and said some very good things about the land
      question and Home Rule. But he always got back to Emmet, O&rsquo;Connell, or one
      of the other patriots mentioned by Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. Now and then, in a very
      loud tone, he said the name of General John Regan. Whenever he did so the
      audience was greatly pleased. He ended by announcing the names of the
      gentlemen who were to form &ldquo;The Statue Committee.&rdquo; Father McCormack came
      first on the list. Mr. Billing was second. Major Kent, Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, Doyle
      and Gallagher himself made up the number. He said that it was unnecessary
      for him to say anything about the fitness of these gentlemen for the high
      and responsible position to which they were being elected by the unanimous
      voice of their fellow countrymen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gallagher descended from his perch, but he was not allowed to sit down. He
      wanted to, because sitting down is a far more dignified way of ending a
      speech than slouching into the background. It was Doyle who interfered
      with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get up out of that, Thady,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know the chair&rsquo;s wanted
      for the American gentleman? How is he to make a speech if you don&rsquo;t give
      him something to stand on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gallagher, who had not actually succeeded in sitting down, left his chair
      with a protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would suit you better to be getting another chair,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would not,&rdquo; said Doyle. &ldquo;Would you have all the chairs that&rsquo;s in it
      brought out to the street?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Billing stood up and smiled pleasantly. Father McCormack&rsquo;s exhortation
      had its effect. More than forty people gathered to hear what the stranger
      had to say. This was courtesy. The hospitality, it was presumed, had
      already been shown by Doyle. Gallagher, who still had hopes of finding out
      something about General John Regan, and Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, who was equally
      anxious to hear the speech, leaned forward eagerly. Father McCormack
      crossed his legs and settled himself as comfortably as possible in his
      chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Billing proved a disappointment as a speaker. The substance of what he
      said was quite admirable, but he only spoke for five minutes. Now an
      audience, even if it is not listening and does not want to listen, is apt
      to complain that it is treated with a want of respect if a speaker gives
      it no more than five minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon,&rdquo; said Mr. Billing, &ldquo;that what&rsquo;s required of me is not oratory
      but dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was true but nude. In Ireland we have a sure instinct in such
      matters, and we know that the nude is never decent. We like everything,
      especially Truth, to have clothes on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five hundred dollars is the amount that I&rsquo;m prepared to hand over to your
      treasurer. As I understand, gentlemen, your doctor has secured the
      services of the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland to unveil the statue. We don&rsquo;t
      figure much on fancy titles on our side, but I guess it&rsquo;s different here,
      and your doctor is a smart man. I may not see that Lord-Lieutenant,
      gentlemen, and I may not see the statue. I shall be researching in the
      principal libraries of the continent of Europe for documents bearing on
      the life of the great general. Whether I am here or not will depend on the
      date which that Lord-Lieutenant and your doctor fix up between them. But
      I&rsquo;ll be along for the occasion if I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The first sentence of Mr. Billing&rsquo;s speech was indecently nude. The
      remainder of it was offensively bald. There was once an elderly and
      cantankerous farm labourer who complained that he could not hear the
      curate when he preached. He was on the next occasion set in the forefront
      of the congregation and the curate spoke directly into his ear. The old
      man was unable to say that he did not hear, but he maintained an aggrieved
      attitude. &ldquo;I heard him,&rdquo; he complained afterwards, &ldquo;but what good was it
      to me? What I want is to have the Gospel druv well home to my soul.&rdquo; The
      feeling of most audiences is very much the same as his was. Unadorned
      statements of fact, or what is meant to be taken as fact, do not satisfy
      them. They like to have something, fact or fiction, driven thunderously
      home into their souls. The only one of Mr. Billing&rsquo;s hearers who was
      thoroughly well satisfied with his speech was Doyle. The statement that
      five hundred dollars were to be handed over to him was, in his judgment,
      of more value than many resonant periods.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Irish courtesy, praised by Father McCor-mack, prevailed against
      the general feeling of disappointment. When Mr. Billing ceased speaking
      there was a moment of doubtful silence. No one quite realised that he had
      really stopped. He had indeed descended from his chair, and, except for
      the top of his head, was invisible to most of the audience. But everyone
      expected him to get up again and start fresh. It seemed quite incredible
      that a public speaker, with an audience ready found for him, could
      possibly throw away a valuable opportunity and content himself with a
      simple five minutes of plain talk. It was not until Father McCormack rose
      from his chair with a sigh and began to make his way towards his
      presbytery that the people understood that the meeting was really at an
      end. Then they cheered quite heartily. Mr. Billing crossed the square and
      walked over towards the hotel. He smiled and nodded right and left as he
      went. An outburst of cheering pursued him through the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sergeant Colgan and Constable Moriarty had stood during the speeches in a
      quiet corner near their barrack. When Father McCormack went home and Mr.
      Billing entered the hotel, they marched with great dignity up and down
      through the people. They looked as if they expected someone to start a
      riot It is the duty of the police in Ireland on all occasions of public
      meetings to look as if there might be a riot, and as if they are quite
      prepared to quell it when it breaks out. It is in this way that they
      justify their existence as a large armed force.
    </p>
    <p>
      Occasionally Sergeant Colgan spoke a word of kindly advice to anyone who
      looked as if he had drunk more than two bottles of porter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be as well for you, Patsy,&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;to be getting along
      home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Or, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking, Timothy John, that you&rsquo;d be better this minute if you
      were at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There are no stronger believers in the value of the domestic hearth than
      the police. They always want everyone to go home.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one, least of all the individuals who received the advice personally,
      was inclined to leave the square. The meeting might be over, but there was
      still hope that young Kerrigan would muster the town band again and play
      &ldquo;The Bonnie, Bonnie Banks of Loch Lomond&rdquo; once or twice more. He did not
      do so, but the waiting people were rewarded for their patience by two
      events of some interest. Mr. Gregg came out of the barrack and crossed the
      square rapidly. He caught Dr. O&rsquo;Grady and Major Kent just as they were
      turning to follow Mr. Billing into the hotel. Mr. Gregg was in uniform,
      and the determined way in which he took Dr. O&rsquo;Grady by the arm would have
      made most people uncomfortable. It is not pleasant, even if your
      conscience is quite clear, to be grabbed suddenly by a police officer in
      the middle of the street. But Dr. O&rsquo;Grady did not seem to mind. He went,
      though not very willingly, with Mr. Gregg into the police barrack. Major
      Kent followed them. Several men, perhaps a dozen, drifted across the
      square towards the barrack door. They had some hope of finding out what
      Mr. Gregg wanted with the doctor. They were not, however, given the
      opportunity of peering through the barrack windows. Sergeant Colgan saw
      them in good time and dispersed them at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get along home now out of that,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;every one of yez.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then another event of great interest occurred. Mr. Billing backed his
      large motor-car along the lane which led from Doyle&rsquo;s back yard, and
      emerged into the square. There the car growled angrily while he shifted
      the levers and twisted the steering wheel. The people scattered this way
      and that while the machine, darting backwards and forwards, was gradually
      turned round. A splendid burst of cheering pursued him when he finally
      sped down the street and disappeared. It was understood by those who heard
      his speech that he had gone off at more than twenty miles an hour to
      ransack the great European libraries for information about General John
      Regan. Everyone felt that the splendid eagerness of his departure
      reflected a glory on Ballymoy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gregg led Dr. O&rsquo;Grady and Major Kent into his office. He shut the
      door, offered his two guests chairs, and then lit a cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather an awkward business,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and perhaps I oughtn&rsquo;t to say
      anything about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it hasn&rsquo;t anything to do with me personally,&rdquo; said the Major, &ldquo;I think
      I&rsquo;ll leave you and the doctor to settle it together. I want to get home as
      soon as I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it does affect you more or less,&rdquo; said Mr. Gregg. &ldquo;But of course
      you&rsquo;ll regard anything I say to you now as strictly confidential.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out with it, Gregg,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;I know by the look in your eye
      that you can&rsquo;t possibly keep it to yourself, whatever it is. You&rsquo;re simply
      bursting to tell it, whatever it is, whether we promise to keep it secret
      or not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; said Gregg, &ldquo;it wouldn&rsquo;t suit my book to have it generally
      known that I told you. It wouldn&rsquo;t suit at all. That fellow Ford is a
      vindictive sort of beast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s Ford, is it?&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;I was afraid he might turn
      nasty. What an ass he is! Why can&rsquo;t he see that we&rsquo;re giving him the
      chance of his life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s doing his best to put a spoke in your wheel, O&rsquo;Grady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he got anything against the statue?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly the statue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or found out anything discreditable about the General?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor asked this question a little anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Gregg, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he knows a thing about the General. He
      asked me this morning who he was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, O&rsquo;Grady,&rdquo; said the Major. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d far better drop this whole
      business. What&rsquo;s the good of going on with it? A joke&rsquo;s a joke all right,
      but there&rsquo;s no use pushing things too far.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What Ford&rsquo;s trying to do,&rdquo; said Gregg, &ldquo;is to crab the Lord-Lieutenant
      part of the business. I thought I&rsquo;d better tell you, so that you&rsquo;d know
      exactly how things stand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve not told me much, so far,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s Ford&rsquo;s
      particular line?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect he has more than one card up his sleeve,&rdquo; said Gregg, &ldquo;but what
      he said to me this morning was that you couldn&rsquo;t possibly have the
      Lord-Lieutenant down here for any kind of public function unless&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;As it just happens I have a letter in my
      pocket this minute&mdash;&mdash;. It came by the midday post, just before
      the meeting, and I haven&rsquo;t shown it to anyone yet. He&rsquo;s coming this day
      fortnight, and will unveil the statue with the greatest pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That settles it,&rdquo; said the Major, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll have to drop it now, whether
      you want to or not. You can&rsquo;t possibly have a statue ready by this day
      fortnight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ford&rsquo;s point,&rdquo; said Gregg&mdash;&ldquo;and there&rsquo;s something in it, you know&mdash;is
      that the Lord-Lieutenant can&rsquo;t attend a public function unless &lsquo;God Save
      the King&rsquo; is played when he arrives. He simply must have that tune on
      account of his position. That&rsquo;s what Ford says, anyhow. And I&rsquo;m inclined
      to think he&rsquo;s right. It always is played, I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll play it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the Major. &ldquo;If you attempt to get the town band to play
      &lsquo;God Save the King&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you can really,&rdquo; said Gregg. &ldquo;I know you have a lot of
      influence with these fellows, but that blackguard Gallagher would get
      their backs up and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be a riot,&rdquo; said the Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be no riot whatever,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;if the thing&rsquo;s managed
      properly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your affair, of course,&rdquo; said Gregg, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t particularly want
      to have you going about under police protection, and that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ll be
      doing if Thady Gallagher catches you corrupting the nationalist principles
      of the people of Ballymoy by teaching the town band to play &lsquo;God Save the
      King.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This threat seemed to produce a certain effect on Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. He sat
      silent for nearly a minute. Then he asked Gregg for a cigarette, lit it,
      and smoked thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Gregg,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;How many people are there in Ballymoy,
      do you think, who would recognise &lsquo;God Save the King&rsquo; if it was played
      suddenly when they weren&rsquo;t expecting it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, lots,&rdquo; said Gregg, &ldquo;lots.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would, I suppose,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;and the Major would. Ford
      would, I suppose. Father McCormack might. What about your police?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sergeant might think it was &lsquo;Auld Lang Syne,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Gregg, &ldquo;he has no
      ear whatever. But Moriarty would know it the minute he heard it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Moriarty might be made to keep his mouth shut,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;You
      could threaten him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your idea,&rdquo; said Gregg, &ldquo;is to spring it on the town band under some
      other name and have it played as if&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d tell them that it was one of Moore&rsquo;s Melodies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No good,&rdquo; said Gregg. &ldquo;Far too many people know it. Even if you shut up
      Moriarty in a cell between this and then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The thing for you to do, O&rsquo;Grady,&rdquo; said the Major bitterly, &ldquo;is to get a
      version of &lsquo;God Save the King &lsquo;with variations. I once heard &lsquo;Home, Sweet
      Home,&rsquo; done that way and it was all I could do to make out what tune it
      was meant to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s probably meant to be sarcastic,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s not
      at all a bad idea. I&rsquo;ve heard &lsquo;Home Sweet Home&rsquo; done that way and I know
      exactly how it goes. &lsquo;Tum&mdash;tum&mdash;&mdash;tiddle&mdash;adle&mdash;diddle&mdash;tum&mdash;tum&mdash;twee&mdash;
      Mid pleasures and palaces&mdash;Tiddle&mdash;tiddle&mdash;tum&mdash;tiddle&mdash;rat&mdash;a
      ti&mdash;tee&mdash; too&mdash;though we may roam.&rsquo; Just as you think that
      you&rsquo;re going to recognise the tune it kind of fades away and you&rsquo;re left
      with the impression that small dogs are chasing each other up and down the
      piano. I don&rsquo;t see why something of the same kind mightn&rsquo;t be done with
      &lsquo;God Save the King,&rsquo; The Lord-Lieutenant would be quite satisfied, because
      he&rsquo;d think we were always just going to begin and probably come to the
      conclusion in the end it was the fault of the band that the tune never
      quite came off. On the other hand Gallagher, whatever suspicions he might
      have, couldn&rsquo;t possibly swear that we were playing anything objectionable.
      I wonder if there&rsquo;s a version of &lsquo;God Save the King&rsquo; with variations to be
      got anywhere?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never heard of one,&rdquo; said Gregg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll write to-night,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;If there isn&rsquo;t such a thing I
      might work one up myself. It can&rsquo;t be very difficult.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will be just what&rsquo;s wanted,&rdquo; said the Major, &ldquo;to ensure the success
      of the day. A musical composition of yours, O&rsquo;Grady, played by our own
      town band, will be quite likely to distract the Lord-Lieutenant&rsquo;s
      attention from the fact that here&rsquo;s no statue here for him to unveil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t mind my using your piano, Major,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t
      got one of my own, and I&rsquo;ll have to strum it out for a bit before I get it
      into shape for the band.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be a score off Ford,&rdquo; said Gregg, &ldquo;if you succeed. But I don&rsquo;t
      expect you will.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Inflexible determination is one of the qualities which the truly great
      leader of men shares with the domestic pig; though in the case of the pig
      it is generally spoken of as obstinacy. But the leader&mdash;General,
      Prime Minister or Captain of Industry&mdash;is distinguished from the pig
      by a certain intellectual suppleness which makes his obstinacy a more
      effective though less showy thing. The pig, being determined to go his own
      way, has no better idea than to tug desperately against the rope which is
      tied round his ankle. He tugs unwaveringly up to the very last moment, but
      in the end he is beaten because his master, having at command stout sticks
      and other instruments of torture, is stronger than he is. It is noble and
      heroic of the pig to persist in refusing to recognise that merely tugging
      the opposite way is no use to him. The great commander is wiser and in
      reality no less noble. He realises very early that destiny, armed with
      whips and goads, has a rope round his leg. He tugs, but when he finds that
      the rope will not break and that the whip cuts cruelly, he stops tugging
      and goes about to outwit destiny. Pretending to yield to the pull of the
      rope, he succeeds at last in getting his own way. Thus a general, faced by
      a hostile army, securely entrenched on the opposite bank of a deep river,
      does not make more than one attempt to swim his men across in the face of
      a concentrated rifle fire. The pig would make several attempts, would go
      on trying until he had no soldiers left, because he would feel that the
      only thing really worth doing was to assert himself against the confident
      foe. But the general, when he has lost enough men to convince him of the
      impossibility of a frontal attack by swimming, stops trying it and adopts
      another plan. He sees not only the insolent flags which wave upon the
      opposite bank, but the far off end of the campaign. He is not less
      determined than the pig would be to chastise the foe which is thwarting
      him, but he sees that this can be done quite as effectually by occupying
      the enemy&rsquo;s capital as by the mere winning of a battle. He understands
      that it is good to sacrifice the immediate for the sake of the ultimate
      object. He gives up the idea of fighting his way across and sends out
      scouts to discover the source of the river. When he finds it he leaves
      part of his army to watch the enemy while the other part marches round the
      end of the river and enters the enemy&rsquo;s chief stronghold from the back.
      Thus he gains his object and establishes his character for determination
      without losing half his army.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Lucius O&rsquo;Grady was a born leader of men. He discovered very soon that
      in the matter of the performance of &ldquo;God Save the King&rdquo; by the town band,
      fate had a rope round his leg and was likely to scourge him uncomfortably
      if he pulled against it. The introduction of variations into the tune
      proved to be a much more difficult matter than he had supposed. He worked
      hard for six hours on Major Kent&rsquo;s piano, and produced two versions of
      which he thought well, though neither of them completely satisfied him. He
      sent for Constable Moriarty and played them over to him. Moriarty sat and
      listened to the first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you know what that tune was, Moriarty?&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would, of course. Anybody would. I don&rsquo;t say but there&rsquo;s bits in it
      that isn&rsquo;t right, but you have the tune safe enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would Thady Gallagher know it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He would,&rdquo; said Moriarty, &ldquo;and what&rsquo;s more he&rsquo;d be lepping mad when he
      heard it. And you couldn&rsquo;t wonder. You wouldn&rsquo;t like it yourself, doctor,
      if somebody was to play a tune at you that you hated worse nor you hate
      the devil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. O&rsquo;Grady was disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that he wouldn&rsquo;t be taken in by the
      variations? I don&rsquo;t know whether you quite realise the number of
      variations there are? Just listen to me again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He played his composition through once more, touching the notes which gave
      the tune very softly, hammering hard at the long runs and fiery groups of
      semi-quavers which he had sandwiched in between the scraps of tune.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say,&rdquo; said Moriarty, &ldquo;that you&rsquo;ve destroyed it altogether;
      though it&rsquo;s my opinion that it&rsquo;s better the way it was before you set your
      hand to it. But anyhow you needn&rsquo;t be uneasy. There isn&rsquo;t a man, woman or
      child that ever heard the tune but would know what you&rsquo;re aiming at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. O&rsquo;Grady felt that Moriarty&rsquo;s judgment in the matter was too decisive
      and confident to be ignored.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Now listen to this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He played through the second of his two compositions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what tune is that, Moriarty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Moriarty scratched his head and looked inquiringly at the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it what tune is that that you&rsquo;re asking me?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. What tune is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no tune at all,&rdquo; said Moriarty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say you don&rsquo;t recognise it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not, and what&rsquo;s more nobody could. For there&rsquo;s no tune in it, only
      noise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor hesitated. Moriarty&rsquo;s opinion was in one respect quite
      satisfactory. Neither Gallagher nor anyone else in Ballymoy was likely to
      recognise the tune. It might, of course, fail to impress the
      Lord-Lieutenant as being quite the proper thing. But that was a difficulty
      which could be got over. The Lord-Lieutenant was not likely to listen very
      attentively, and if he were told definitely that the band was playing &ldquo;God
      Save the King&rdquo; he might possibly believe it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;of teaching that piece of music to the
      town band.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll fail you to do that,&rdquo; said Moriarty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can try it,&rdquo; said Moriarty, &ldquo;but you&rsquo;ll not be able. Anything those
      fellows could play, I&rsquo;d be able to whistle, and if it&rsquo;s what I couldn&rsquo;t
      whistle they&rsquo;ll not be able to play it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could whistle that all right if you tried.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not. Nor I couldn&rsquo;t play it on an ivy leaf, nor yet on a comb,
      and if I couldn&rsquo;t there&rsquo;s nobody else could. I&rsquo;m not saying it isn&rsquo;t good
      music, doctor, for it may be. But there&rsquo;s neither beginning nor end of it,
      nor there isn&rsquo;t anything in the middle that a man would be able to catch
      hold of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. O&rsquo;Grady shut the piano with a bang. Constable Moriarty rose from his
      seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s nothing more you&rsquo;ll be wanting with me, doctor,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it
      might be as well if I was getting back to the barrack. The sergeant&rsquo;s
      terrible particular these times. Mr. Gregg, the D.I., has him annoyed with
      finding fault here and there and everywhere. Not that I blame Mr. Gregg,
      for everybody knows he&rsquo;s a nice quiet kind of a man who&rsquo;d ask for nothing
      only to be let alone. But that&rsquo;s what he can&rsquo;t get on account of Mr.
      Ford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Ford&rsquo;s a public nuisance,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady; &ldquo;but I think we&rsquo;ll be
      able to get rid of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be no great harm if he was dead,&rdquo; said Moriarty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Lord-Lieutenant,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;is almost sure to promote him.
      That kind of man who never can let other people&rsquo;s business alone, is just
      suited to Dublin Castle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Moriarty got as far as the door of the room and then stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will it be all right,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;about Mary Ellen? You&rsquo;ll remember,
      doctor, that I was speaking to you about her, the way she&rsquo;d be given the
      chance of speaking to the Lord-Lieutenant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll settle about her at once,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;Did you say you were
      going straight back to the barrack?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; said Moriarty. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be better for me if I do on account of the
      way Mr. Ford does be talking to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going so straight that you won&rsquo;t see Mary Ellen on the way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It could be,&rdquo; said Moriarty, &ldquo;that I might see her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then, do. And tell her to meet me at Mrs. Gregg&rsquo;s house at&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       He glanced at his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see, it&rsquo;s nearly half past two, and I&rsquo;ll have to spend a few
      minutes pacifying the Major. Suppose you tell her to meet me at Mrs.
      Gregg&rsquo;s at a quarter past three. Will you be sure to give her that
      message?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said Moriarty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t you keep the girl late now, Moriarty, with love making in the
      pig-stye or any nonsense of that kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it likely I would?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very likely. But don&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not likely then, seeing as how I ought to be back in the barrack
      this minute on account of the way Mr. Gregg has the sergeant annoyed&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one thing worse than keeping Mary Ellen late,&rdquo; said Dr.
      O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;and that is delaying me. Be off with you at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Constable Moriarty marched off towards the barrack, fully determined to
      call on Mary Ellen on the way. Dr. O&rsquo;Grady went into the stable yard to
      look for Major Kent. He found him smoking a pipe and reading the last
      number of the <i>Connacht Eagle</i> in an empty loose box.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d like to know,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;ve finished with
      the piano, so you can go back into the house again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite sure you&rsquo;re finished?&rdquo; said the Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because if there are any final touches to put to your oratorio, you&rsquo;d
      better do them to-day. The piano won&rsquo;t be there to-morrow. I&rsquo;ve made up my
      mind to sell it at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silly thing to do,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t get half what it&rsquo;s worth
      if you sell it in a hurry like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even if I have to pay someone to take it away,&rdquo; said the Major, &ldquo;I shall
      make a good bargain. It&rsquo;s better to lose a little money than to spend the
      rest of my life in a lunatic asylum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know your own business best, of course, and if you think you can
      preserve what little intelligence you have by giving Thady Gallagher or
      some other fellow a present of your piano&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I can save myself from being turned into a gibbering maniac,&rdquo;
       said the Major, &ldquo;by making sure that you&rsquo;ll never have the chance of
      composing music in my house again. Since eight o&rsquo;clock this morning you&rsquo;ve
      been at it. I could hear you whenever I went, mixing up hymns and waltzes
      and things with &lsquo;God Save the King.&rsquo; I tried to get a bit of lunch at half
      past one, but I had to fly from the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s over now anyhow,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;And you needn&rsquo;t sell the piano.
      I&rsquo;ve given up the idea of producing a new version of that tune for the
      Lord-Lieutenant. I find that the thing can&rsquo;t be done in the time. I&rsquo;m
      going to give him &lsquo;Rule Britannia&rsquo; instead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With variations?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Quite plain. It&rsquo;ll do him just as well as the other. In fact from his
      point of view it&rsquo;s rather the more patriotic tune of the two, and there
      won&rsquo;t be any local objection to it because nobody can possibly recognise
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was in this way that Dr. O&rsquo;Grady showed the true greatness of his mind.
      A weaker man, daunted by the difficulty of arranging &ldquo;God Save the King&rdquo;
       in such a way as to suit all tastes, might have given up the attempt to
      provide a musical welcome for the Lord-Lieutenant. A man of narrow
      obstinacy, the kind of man who is really like a pig, would have
      persevered, in spite of Constable Moriarty&rsquo;s warning, in trying to teach
      his variations to the town band. Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, knowing that the main thing
      was the success of his general scheme, turned from a tune which presented
      insuperable difficulties, and fixed upon another, which would, he hoped,
      be comparatively easy to manage. The Major ought to have admired him; but
      did not He was in a condition of extreme nervous exasperation which
      rendered him unfit to admire anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get us all into an infernal mess with your foolery,&rdquo; he said
      sulkily, &ldquo;and when you do, you needn&rsquo;t come to me to help you out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t. But don&rsquo;t forget the committee meeting to-morrow morning. Half
      past eleven, in Doyle&rsquo;s Hotel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What committee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strictly speaking,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s two committees&mdash;the
      Statue Erection Committee and the Lord-Lieutenant Reception Committee&mdash;but
      the same people are on both, so we may as well make one meeting do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; said the Major, &ldquo;in the hope, utterly vain of course, of
      keeping you from further excesses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;And now I must hurry off. I&rsquo;ve a lot to do
      between this and then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Major Kent was a kind-hearted man. He had suffered intensely during the
      earlier part of the day and for some hours had been seriously angry with
      Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. But his sense of hospitality was stronger than his
      resentment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop for half an hour,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and have something to eat Now that
      you&rsquo;ve given up punishing my poor old piano we might have lunch in peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t possibly waste time in eating. I&rsquo;ve far too much to do. To tell you
      the truth, Major, I don&rsquo;t expect to sit down to a square meal until I join
      the Lord-Lieutenant&rsquo;s luncheon party. Till then I must snatch a crust as I
      can while running from one thing to another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. O&rsquo;Grady mounted his bicycle and hurried off. He reached the Greggs&rsquo; 
      house at twenty minutes past three, Mary Ellen was standing on the step
      outside the door, smiling in a good-humoured way. Mrs. Gregg, who looked
      hot and puzzled, was just inside the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Dr. O&rsquo;Grady,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you&rsquo;ve come. This girl won&rsquo;t go
      away and I can&rsquo;t make out what she wants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was Constable Moriarty bid me come,&rdquo; said Mary Ellen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;I arranged for her to be here. I&rsquo;ll
      explain everything in one moment. Is that the only frock you own, Mary
      Ellen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not; but I have another along with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t expect the other is much better,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;Just look at
      that dress, will you, Mrs. Gregg?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gregg looked at Mary Ellen&rsquo;s clothes carefully. She did not appear to
      admire them much.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a long tear in the skirt,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It might be mended, of
      course, but&mdash;and she has only one button on her blouse, and her boots
      are pretty well worn out, and she&rsquo;s horribly dirty all over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In fact,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;you couldn&rsquo;t very well present her to the
      Lord-Lieutenant as she is at present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Lord-Lieutenant!&rdquo; said Mrs. Gregg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I forgot to mention,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;that Mary Ellen must be
      presented. She&rsquo;s the grand niece of General John Regan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you really?&rdquo; said Mrs. Gregg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s what the doctor has put out about me,&rdquo; said Mary Ellen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a matter of what I&rsquo;ve put out or haven&rsquo;t put out,&rdquo; said Dr.
      O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;Mr. Billing has publicly acknowledged her as the grand niece of
      the General. Didn&rsquo;t he, Mary Ellen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did,&rdquo; said Mary Ellen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Mr. Billing is the greatest living authority on everything connected
      with the General. So that settles it. Under those circumstances she must,
      of course, be presented to the Lord-Lieutenant when he comes down to
      unveil the statue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what Mrs. Ford will say?&rdquo; said Mrs. Gregg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll talk about that afterwards. What I want to get at now is this: Will
      you undertake to see that Mary Ellen is properly dressed for the
      ceremony?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I couldn&rsquo;t possibly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gregg looked at Mary Ellen again as she spoke, looked at her very
      carefully and then smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary Ellen was also smiling. The proper dressing of Mary Ellen was plainly
      a very difficult task. Mrs. Gregg&rsquo;s smile was at first contemptuous. Mary
      Ellen&rsquo;s, on the other hand, was purely good-natured, and therefore very
      attractive, Mrs. Gregg began to relent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come in?&rdquo; she said to Dr. O&rsquo;Grady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Mary Ellen, you sit down on that chair in the
      hall and wait till we call you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know can I wait,&rdquo; said Mary Ellen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Moriarty&rsquo;s lurking about for you,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;let him wait.
      It&rsquo;ll do him good. It&rsquo;s a great mistake for you to make yourself too
      cheap. No girl ought to. Moriarty will think a great deal more of you in
      the end if you keep him waiting every day for half an hour or so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not him I&rsquo;m thinking of,&rdquo; said Mary Ellen, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s Mr. Doyle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. O&rsquo;Grady took no notice of this remark. He did not believe that Mary
      Ellen was very much afraid of Mr. Doyle. He followed Mrs. Gregg into the
      dining-room. Mary Ellen sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She really is rather a pretty girl,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gregg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll undertake the job,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t have to pay
      for anything, you know. We&rsquo;ll charge whatever you like to buy against the
      statue fund.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gregg did not appear to be listening. She was thinking deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have an old silk slip,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;which might be made down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Capital! A silk slip will be the very thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. O&rsquo;Grady had no idea what a silk slip might be. But his enthusiastic
      welcome of the suggestion passed unnoticed. Mrs. Gregg was still thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could get a white muslin,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;with an embroidered yoke and a
      wide collar. It wouldn&rsquo;t cost very much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;d like the thing done well,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;not extravagantly, of
      course, but well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shell look quite sweet,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gregg; &ldquo;but what will Mrs. Ford say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll have to be kept in a good temper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kept!&rdquo; said Mrs. Gregg, giggling delightedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was very much afraid of Mrs. Ford, but she found a fearful joy in
      entering into a conspiracy against her with Dr. O&rsquo;Grady for ally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kept!&rdquo; she repeated, &ldquo;but she never is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My idea,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;is that you should dress Mary Ellen
      yourself, according to your own ideas, and at the same time consult with
      Mrs. Ford, giving her the impression that she&rsquo;s doing the whole thing
      herself. I should think you ought to be able to manage that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This did not seem to Mrs. Gregg a very easy thing to do. She hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said at last. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how I could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All that&rsquo;s required,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;is a little tact. You are always
      good at tact, Mrs. Gregg. I&rsquo;m perfectly certain that you&rsquo;ll be able to
      manage. You must suggest each garment you intend to put on the girl in
      such a way that Mrs. Ford will think that she suggested it. That ought to
      be easy enough.&rdquo; Everybody likes being credited with the possession of
      tact. This is curious, because hardly anyone likes being called a liar;
      and yet tact is simply a delicate form of lying. So, of course, is
      politeness of every kind, and nobody considers it wrong to aim at being
      polite. Mrs. Gregg, who would certainly have resented an accusation of
      habitual untruthfulness, felt flattered when Dr. O&rsquo;Grady said she was
      tactful. She even believed him and allowed herself to be persuaded to
      undertake the management of Mrs. Ford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll leave the whole business in your
      hands. I have to be off. But you&rsquo;ve no time to lose. You&rsquo;ll have to set
      about your work at once. I&rsquo;ll send Mary Ellen to you as I go through the
      hall. You can measure her, and then take her over to see Mrs. Ford. After
      that you&rsquo;d better order the new dress. If there&rsquo;s any hitch in the
      proceedings you can send for me, but I don&rsquo;t see why there should be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook hands with Mrs. Gregg and hurried from the room, without giving
      her the chance of making any kind of protest or asking any more questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found Mary Ellen seated on an uncomfortable oak chair in the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary Ellen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;would you like a new dress?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then go into the dining-room&mdash;the room I&rsquo;ve just come out of. You&rsquo;ll
      find Mrs. Gregg there. Do exactly what she tells you without making any
      objections or asking questions. If she insists on your washing your face,
      wash it, without grumbling. If Moriarty is waiting for you anywhere
      between this and the town&mdash;&mdash; Is Moriarty waiting for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He might.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if he is, I&rsquo;ll clear him out of the way. You&rsquo;ll be going into the
      town in a few minutes with Mrs. Ford and Mrs. Gregg. It wouldn&rsquo;t do at all
      to have him making eyes at you from the side of the road when you&rsquo;re
      walking with those two ladies. Mrs. Gregg mightn&rsquo;t mind; but Mrs. Ford
      would be certain to object. She&rsquo;s not the kind of lady who likes to see
      other people enjoying themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t do the like,&rdquo; said Mary Ellen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t trust him,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moriarty was, in fact, waiting for Mary Ellen about a hundred yards from
      the gate of the Greggs&rsquo; house. Dr. O&rsquo;Grady rebuked him sharply. Moriarty
      asserted that he was engaged in patrolling that particular road in simple
      obedience to the call of duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may possibly be true,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;though it doesn&rsquo;t sound
      likely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the sergeant gave me my orders,&rdquo; said Moriarty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Patrol some other road, then,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not wanted
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the sergeant said was that it would be better for me to patrol along
      between Mr. Gregg&rsquo;s house and Mr. Ford&rsquo;s, so that if either the one or the
      other of them was to see me he&rsquo;d know that I <i>was</i> patrolling. I
      wouldn&rsquo;t say a word against Mr. Gregg, who&rsquo;s a nice gentleman enough, and
      easy pleased. But it&rsquo;s hard to pacify Mr. Ford, and the sergeant thought&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can tell you this,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;that if Mrs. Ford catches you
      lying in wait for Mary Ellen on the road outside her house, it will be a
      jolly sight harder to pacify Mr. Ford than it was before. Surely you can
      understand that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Moriarty understood it thoroughly. He was not very well pleased, but he
      was a young man of considerable prudence, and was filled with a sincere
      desire to rise in his profession. He spent the rest of the afternoon in
      patrolling a road at the other end of Ballymoy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. O&rsquo;Grady hurried on. His next stop was at the door of Kerrigan&rsquo;s shop.
      The elder Kerrigan was leaning against the wooden slab on which he was
      accustomed to cut up joints. He was smoking a pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your son?&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s within in the back yard,&rdquo; said Kerrigan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell him I want to see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure can he come to you; for he&rsquo;s taking the skin off a sheep
      that he&rsquo;s just after slaughtering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him wash his hands,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;The sheep can wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure will he come,&rdquo; said Kerrigan. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not overly much pleased
      with you this minute, doctor, and that&rsquo;s the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s on account of your saying that he was thinking of getting married to
      Mary Ellen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was Gallagher said that. I&rsquo;d nothing to do with it one way or the
      other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be minding myself what you said,&rdquo; said Kerrigan, &ldquo;knowing well
      that you wouldn&rsquo;t be meaning any harm, whatever it was; though the girl&rsquo;s
      no match for him, and I wouldn&rsquo;t care for him to be carrying on with her,
      when it&rsquo;s a girl with a fortune he ought to get, and what&rsquo;s more, can get,
      whenever I choose to ask for her. But I wouldn&rsquo;t pay any attention to what
      was put out about him and Mary Ellen. I&rsquo;m only telling you so as you&rsquo;d
      know why it is that the boy&rsquo;s mind is riz against you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What nonsense! Everybody in the place knows that it&rsquo;s Constable Moriarty
      who&rsquo;s after the girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that that&rsquo;s troubling the boy. On account of Constable Moriarty
      being a comrade of his; so that he wouldn&rsquo;t like him to be thinking&mdash;&mdash;
      But sure, I&rsquo;ll fetch him for you, if you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Young Kerrigan appeared a few minutes later. His father did not come back
      with him. He may have felt it necessary, in the interests of his business,
      to go on skinning the sheep. It was evident at once that the young man was
      in a bad temper, but Dr. O&rsquo;Grady did not mean to waste time in
      explanations if he could possibly help it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me, Kerrigan,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;do you know this tune?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He whistled &ldquo;Rule Britannia&rdquo; slowly and distinctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know it,&rdquo; said young Kerrigan, &ldquo;nor I don&rsquo;t want to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. O&rsquo;Grady whistled it through again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good tune,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It would be a nice one for the band to
      learn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;To look at the expression
      of your face anybody&rsquo;d think that the sheep in the back yard had been
      skinning you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know well what&rsquo;s the matter with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re nursing a grievance,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;because Thady
      Gallagher told the American gentleman that you were married to Mary Ellen
      and had twins, you ought to have more sense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is always very difficult to remain in a bad temper with anyone who
      insists on being pleasant and cheerful. Young Kerrigan began to give way.
      He grinned unwillingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the first I heard of twins,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he only said it to please the American gentleman,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady.
      &ldquo;Nobody believed him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure I know well enough,&rdquo; said young Kerrigan, &ldquo;that there has to be lies
      told to the likes of that one. How else would you content them? I wouldn&rsquo;t
      mind myself what was said, knowing it was meant for the best, only that
      Constable Moriarty&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Moriarty doesn&rsquo;t mind a bit,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady; &ldquo;so if it&rsquo;s only his
      feelings you&rsquo;re thinking of, you may just as well listen to this tune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He whistled &ldquo;Rule Britannia&rdquo; through once more. He threw great spirit into
      the last few bars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good tune enough,&rdquo; said young Kerrigan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could the band learn it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It could, of course, if so be that I had the tune right on the cornet. It
      would be a queer thing if I couldn&rsquo;t incense the rest of them into doing
      what had to be done with the other instruments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t play the cornet myself,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll whistle the
      tune to you as often as you like, or if you prefer it we might get the
      loan of a piano somewhere, and I&rsquo;ll play it for you. I can&rsquo;t borrow the
      Major&rsquo;s again for reasons which I&rsquo;m not in a position to explain to you,
      but we can easily get the use of another if you think it would help you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The whistling will do,&rdquo; said young Kerrigan. &ldquo;Will you come inside with
      me now and I&rsquo;ll try can I get it. But, doctor&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated and looked doubtfully at Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. It was plain that he
      had a favour to ask and was a little afraid of asking it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady encouragingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If so be that you were to see Moriarty&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; said young
      Kerrigan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he hesitated again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see far too much of him,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be obliged to you if you&rsquo;d tell him that I never looked next nor nigh
      Mary Ellen, nor wouldn&rsquo;t. Even if I wanted the girl I wouldn&rsquo;t go behind
      Moriarty&rsquo;s back to get her; and I don&rsquo;t want her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make that perfectly plain to him. Come along now and learn the
      tune.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII
    </h2>
    <p>
      The cornet is of all instruments in an ordinary band the one which
      produces the most penetrating sounds. While young Kerrigan was practising
      a new tune on it all the inhabitants of the town of Bally-moy were able to
      hear him. He was aware of this and sorry for it. He did not, indeed, pity
      his fellow-citizens. He would not have understood a complaint made by a
      nervous person who found himself tortured by a long series of efforts to
      get a note in the middle of a tune right. It would have struck him as mere
      affectation if anyone had objected to hearing the same tune with the same
      gasping wheeze in the middle of it played over a hundred or a hundred and
      fifty times in one evening. Young Kerrigan&rsquo;s dislike of the necessary
      publicity of his practising was similar to that which other artists feel
      when members of the public break in and see their work in an incomplete
      condition. He liked his music to be appreciated. He felt that
      acknowledgment of the stages by which it came to its ultimate perfection
      was likely to diminish its glory. But he had no place in which he could
      practise except the back yard of his father&rsquo;s house, and that,
      unfortunately, was in the very middle of the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to get out of his difficulty young Kerrigan adopted the plan of
      learning new tunes only in autumn and winter, when strong gales were
      blowing. On a calm summer evening every note of the cornet, whether right
      or wrong, was heard. Even the sounds which were not quite notes but only
      painful grunts penetrated open windows and doors. But when a storm was
      raging most of the notes were blown away, and only occasionally, when
      there happened to be a lull, did anybody except young Kerrigan himself
      hear anything. The plan worked out very satisfactorily. Amid the rush and
      clatter of a tempest people took no notice of such stray wailings of the
      cornet as reached their ears. But, like many excellent plans, this one was
      liable to break down in emergencies. It broke down badly when Dr. O&rsquo;Grady
      insisted that the band should learn &ldquo;Rule Britannia&rdquo; in the middle of
      August.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Kerrigan readily got a grip on the tune. He could whistle it and hum
      it quite correctly after he had heard it six or seven times. But to
      reproduce it on the cornet required practise, and the weather was
      remarkably calm and fine. Kerrigan, in spite of his dislike of being
      heard, was obliged to devote the evening to it after the doctor left him.
      Next morning he went at it again, beginning at about eleven o&rsquo;clock. He
      got on very well up to the point at which the words declare that &ldquo;Britons
      never, never, never shall be slaves.&rdquo; The notes which went to the &ldquo;nevers&rdquo;
       were particularly troublesome. He tried them slowly, one by one, leaving a
      short interval between them. He tried them fast, running them into each
      other. He tried beginning the tune again after each mistake, in hope of
      getting over his difficulty, as a bicyclist sometimes gets up a hill, by
      running. He was a man of patient disposition, and he was still working
      hard at one o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Thaddeus Gallagher spent the morning transcribing shorthand notes in
      his office. There had been a singularly interesting meeting of the County
      Council the day before in the neighbouring town of Dunbeg. Gallagher had
      written down every word of an acrimonious debate. He wanted to publish a
      verbatim report of it. As a rule noise of any kind affected him very
      little, and at first he took no notice whatever of young Kerrigan&rsquo;s
      cornet. But the continual repetition of the tune gradually beat it into
      his brain. He found his pencil moving across the paper in a series of
      short staccato bounds every time young Kerrigan got to &ldquo;Never, never,
      never.&rdquo; He became by degrees vaguely uneasy. The tune was one which he had
      certainly heard before. He could not remember where he had heard it. He
      could not remember what it was. But he became more and more sure that it
      was connected in his mind with some unpleasant associations. At last he
      found it impossible to go on with his work. The most passionate invective
      of the most furious of the County Councillors failed to move him to any
      interest. He glanced at his watch. It was just one o&rsquo;clock. The meeting of
      the Reception Committee was to take place at half-past one. Gallagher felt
      that he had just time to investigate thoroughly the disagreeable tune. He
      got up and left his office.
    </p>
    <p>
      Constable Moriarty was standing at the door of the barrack listening to
      young Kerrigan. Being himself a musician, he appreciated the difficulty of
      playing &ldquo;Rule Britannia&rdquo; on a cornet, and enjoyed hearing young Kerrigan&rsquo;s
      efforts. When he saw Gallagher come out of his office he was greatly
      pleased, and showed his feeling by grinning broadly. Gallagher saw the
      grin, and his suspicion that the tune was an offensive one deepened at
      once. He crossed the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that young Kerrigan&rsquo;s playing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a new tune,&rdquo; said Moriarty, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s hoped that the town band will
      learn it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did he get it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m after hearing,&rdquo; said Moriarty, &ldquo;that it was the doctor taught it to
      him. But I don&rsquo;t know is that true. You can&rsquo;t believe the half of what you
      hear in this town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What tune is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I could put a name to it this minute; but there&rsquo;s no
      need for you to be uneasy, Mr. Gallagher. It&rsquo;s not what you think it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not thinking about it at all,&rdquo; said Gallagher, very untruthfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad of that,&rdquo; said Moriarty. &ldquo;I was afraid from the look of you as
      you came out of the office that you might be thinking it was &lsquo;God Save the
      King.&rsquo; But it&rsquo;s not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was thinking no such thing, for young Kerrigan knows and the doctor
      knows, and you know yourself, Constable Moriarty, that the people of this
      town is all good Nationalists, and that if the tune you&rsquo;re after naming
      was to be played in the streets&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not it, anyway,&rdquo; said Moriarty, &ldquo;so you may make your mind easy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gallagher&rsquo;s mind was very far from being easy, but he saw that he was not
      likely to get any more information out of Constable Moriarty. He crossed
      the road and entered the hotel. Doyle was in the commercial room trying to
      induce Mary Ellen to sweep the floor. It was in the commercial room that
      the meeting of the Committee was to be held that afternoon. Doyle wanted
      some, if not all, of the dirt removed from the floor beforehand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What tune&rsquo;s that young Kerrigan&rsquo;s playing?&rdquo; said Gallagher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Doyle. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve more to do than to be listening to
      tunes. Mary Ellen, can you not see that there&rsquo;s three corks out of porter
      bottles underneath the table? Will you take them out of it now, like a
      good girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not satisfied in my mind about that tune,&rdquo; said Gallagher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What harm is there in it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know yet is there any harm, but I don&rsquo;t like it, and I&rsquo;d be glad
      if I knew what tune it is. I have it in my mind that it&rsquo;s a tune that
      ought not to be played.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary Ellen,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;what tune is it that young Kerrigan&rsquo;s playing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How would I know?&rdquo; said Mary Ellen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, put down that sweeping brush,&rdquo; said Doyle. &ldquo;For all the good you&rsquo;re
      doing with it you might as well never have taken it up. I never seen such
      a girl. Put it down now and run across to Constable Moriarty, who&rsquo;s
      standing at the door of the barrack&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be ashamed,&rdquo; said Mary Ellen, &ldquo;so I would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re not ashamed of the state this room&rsquo;s in,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;it would
      take more than Moriarty to shame you. Run along now, when you&rsquo;re bid, and
      ask him what tune it is that Kerrigan&rsquo;s playing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary Ellen, who hoped that the interruption might put an end to the
      sweeping once for all, left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s one in the town that knows the tune,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll be
      Moriarty. I&rsquo;d say myself that he must know pretty near every tune there is
      in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He might tell her,&rdquo; said Gallagher, &ldquo;or he might not. I was talking to
      him this minute and he wouldn&rsquo;t tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll tell Mary Ellen,&rdquo; said Doyle. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s always after that girl, and
      it&rsquo;s my belief he&rsquo;ll tell her anything that she&rsquo;d ask him. There&rsquo;s some
      that&rsquo;s took that way. Foolishness I call it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the way he wouldn&rsquo;t tell me when I asked him,&rdquo; said Gallagher, &ldquo;that
      and the grin on his face when he saw me that has me sure that there&rsquo;s some
      insult intended to the people of this town with that tune. It&rsquo;s what I
      wouldn&rsquo;t stand, and the doctor and the rest of them may make their minds
      up to it. It&rsquo;s what I won&rsquo;t stand is to have tunes played here that is
      against the political convictions of the people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;d do the like?&rdquo; said Doyle soothingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I say is this,&rdquo; said Gallagher, &ldquo;if there&rsquo;s no reason to be ashamed
      of the tune, let them say out boldly what tune it is. I have it in the
      back of my mind that I&rsquo;ve heard that tune before now, and it&rsquo;s not the
      kind of tune that decent men would be listening to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have sense, can&rsquo;t you, Thady. There&rsquo;s nobody wanting to annoy you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There may not be,&rdquo; said Gallagher, &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s more than one in this
      town that&rsquo;s the enemies of the Irish people and would be glad to see the
      cup of freedom dashed from the lips of the men that have spent their lives
      in the struggle for Home Rule and that has it now as good as got.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have sense,&rdquo; said Doyle, but he spoke without real energy or much
      purpose. He had little hope that Gallagher, once embarked on a peroration,
      would stop until he had used up all the words at his command. He was quite
      right in his reading of his friend&rsquo;s character. Gallagher went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t the declared enemies of the people that we&rsquo;d be afraid of,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll meet them in the open field as we&rsquo;ve always met them and
      they&rsquo;ll fly before the spectacle of a united people as they&rsquo;ve always
      fled, the tyrants of other days, the blood-sucking landlords&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God help the poor Major,&rdquo; said Doyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the traitors within the camp,&rdquo; said Gallagher, &ldquo;the men that is
      occupying positions in the gift of the people of Ireland, that&rsquo;s taking
      our pay, and at the same time plotting contrivances for the heaping of
      insults on the dearest convictions of our hearts&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary Ellen entered the room while Gallagher was speaking. Bewildered by
      the splendour of his eloquence she stopped short just inside the door and
      gazed at him with her mouth open. Doyle took advantage of a slight
      hesitation in Gallagher&rsquo;s oration to speak to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What tune is it, Mary Ellen?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t rightly say,&rdquo; said Mary Ellen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you,&rdquo; said Gallagher, &ldquo;that there was underhand work going
      on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What tune did Moriarty say it was?&rdquo; said Doyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said it was a tune the doctor is after teaching young Kerrigan,&rdquo; said
      Mary Ellen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did I tell you?&rdquo; said Gallagher. &ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;ll believe me now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best thing for you to do, Thady.&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;re dead set on
      finding out about that tune is to go and ask young Kerrigan what it is.
      The boy&rsquo;s a decent boy, and he&rsquo;ll tell you if you speak civil to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do that same,&rdquo; said Gallagher, &ldquo;and if I discover&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better be quick about it then,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;for the committee is
      to meet at half after one and I wouldn&rsquo;t like you&rsquo;d miss the proceedings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along with me,&rdquo; said Gallagher. &ldquo;I wish you to hear the way I mean
      to talk to young Kerrigan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doyle did not want to listen to Gallagher browbeating young Kerrigan, but
      he realised that he would save time and a long argument if he went at
      once. He made a last appeal to Mary Ellen to collect at least the corks
      which were on the floor. Then he went out with Gallagher. In the porch of
      the hotel they met Major Kent who was a scrupulously punctual man, on his
      way to the committee meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a bit early, Major,&rdquo; said Doyle. &ldquo;But if you&rsquo;ll step into the
      commercial room you won&rsquo;t have long to wait. Thady and I have to cross the
      street on a matter of business but we&rsquo;ll be back in less than five
      minutes. The doctor might be here any time and I see Father McCormack
      coming along from the presbytery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doyle was unduly optimistic. He was not back in five minutes. He did not,
      indeed, get back for nearly half an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kerrigan, very red in the face, and rather exhausted, was still blowing
      vigorously into his cornet when Gallagher and Doyle entered the back-yard.
      Gallagher went straight to business without wasting any time on
      preliminary politeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you stop that blasted noise,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kerrigan took the cornet from his lips and gazed at Gallagher in extreme
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak civil to the boy,&rdquo; said Doyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What tune is that?&rdquo; said Gallagher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What Mr. Gallagher&rsquo;s meaning to say,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;is that party tunes is
      unsuitable to this locality where the people has always lived in peace and
      harmony, Protestant and Catholic together, and respected one another.
      That&rsquo;s what Mr. Gallagher means, and if Constable Moriarty didn&rsquo;t annoy
      him it&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;d say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a tune the doctor taught me,&rdquo; said young Kerrigan, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s a fine
      tune, so it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the name of it?&rdquo; said Gallagher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; said young Kerrigan, &ldquo;is what I was meaning to ask the doctor next
      time he happened to be passing but if you&rsquo;re in a hurry to know, Mr.
      Gallagher, you can ask him yourself. It&rsquo;s likely you&rsquo;ll be seeing him
      before I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Young Kerrigan&rsquo;s words were perfectly civil; but there was a look in his
      eyes which Gallagher did not like and the tone in which he spoke suggested
      that he meant to be impudent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take no back talk from you,&rdquo; said Gallagher. &ldquo;What tune is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what tune it is,&rdquo; said Kerrigan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a liar,&rdquo; said Gallagher. &ldquo;You know well what tune it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak civil now, Thady,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;speak civil to the boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may be a liar,&rdquo; said Kerrigan, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s the truth I told you this
      minute. And liar or no liar it&rsquo;s the truth I&rsquo;ll speak now, when I tell you
      that I&rsquo;m not near as damned a liar as yourself, Mr. Gallagher. So there&rsquo;s
      for you. What do you mean by telling the American gentleman that I was
      married to Mary Ellen and her with twins? Was that a lie now or was it
      not? Twins! Cock the like of that one up with twins! If I&rsquo;m a liar I&rsquo;d
      tell more sensible lies than that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whisht, now, whisht,&rdquo; said Doyle. &ldquo;Sure if Mr. Gallagher said that, isn&rsquo;t
      the girl a cousin of his own, and hadn&rsquo;t he the best right to say it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along out of this,&rdquo; said Gallagher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sooner you&rsquo;re gone the better I&rsquo;ll be pleased,&rdquo; said Kerrigan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And let me tell you this, Mr. Kerrigan, junior. You&rsquo;ll be sorry for this
      day&rsquo;s work for the longest day ever you live. When the League boys hear,
      and they will hear, about the tune that you mean to play&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along now, Thady,&rdquo; said Doyle. &ldquo;Come along. You&rsquo;ve enough said.
      We&rsquo;re late for the meeting of the committee already, and we&rsquo;ll be later
      yet if you don&rsquo;t come on. You wouldn&rsquo;t like to keep Father McCormack
      waiting on you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had enough of your committee,&rdquo; said Gallagher. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your statue
      only foolishness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure everybody knows that,&rdquo; said Doyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what&rsquo;s your Lord-Lieutenant only&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on, now,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t it for the benefit of the town we&rsquo;re
      doing it? And it&rsquo;s yourself that&rsquo;s always to the fore when there&rsquo;s good
      work to be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not go with you,&rdquo; said Gallagher.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had passed through Kerrigan&rsquo;s shop and reached the street, when
      Gallagher delivered this ultimatum. Doyle hesitated. He was already late
      for the committee meeting. If he waited to coax Gallagher out of his bad
      temper he might miss the meeting altogether. He looked at the door of the
      hotel. Father McCormack was standing at it, waiting, perhaps, for him and
      Gallagher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come now, Thady,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;have sense. Don&rsquo;t you see Father McCormack
      waiting for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see him,&rdquo; said Gallagher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t you know well enough that you&rsquo;ll have no luck if you go against
      the clergy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The appeal was a strong one, and had he been in any ordinary temper
      Gallagher would have yielded to it at once. But he was very angry indeed,
      far too angry to be influenced by purely religious considerations. He
      walked straight across the square to his office, entered it, and slammed
      the door behind him. Doyle followed him as far as the threshold. There he
      stopped and looked round. He saw Father McCormack go into the hotel. A
      minute later Mrs. Gregg hurried down the street and went into the hotel.
      Doyle sighed heavily and entered Gallagher&rsquo;s office. Difficult and
      unpleasant as his task was likely to be, he felt that he must propitiate
      Thady Gallagher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thady,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is there a drop of anything to drink in the place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is not,&rdquo; said Gallagher, &ldquo;nor I wouldn&rsquo;t drink it if there was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This confirmed Doyle&rsquo;s view of the extreme seriousness of the situation.
      That Gallagher should be prepared to defy the clergy was bad enough. That
      he should adopt an ascetic&rsquo;s attitude towards drink was worse. But Doyle
      did not quite believe that Gallagher meant what he said. He opened a door
      at the far end of the office and whistled loudly. A small boy who had been
      cleaning type in the printing-room, appeared, rubbing his inky hands on
      his trousers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Michael Antony,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;will you step across to the hotel and tell
      Mary Ellen to give you the bottle of whisky that she&rsquo;ll find in the
      cupboard in my own room? If you can&rsquo;t find Mary Ellen&mdash;and it&rsquo;s
      hardly ever she is to be found when she&rsquo;s wanted&mdash;you can fetch the
      bottle yourself. If you don&rsquo;t know the way to my room you ought to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Michael Antony, who was very well accustomed to errands of this kind, went
      off at once. Doyle glanced at Gallagher, who appeared to be absorbed in
      completing the transcription of his shorthand notes, the task at which he
      had been interrupted in the morning by young Kerrigan&rsquo;s cornet playing. He
      seemed to be very busy. Doyle got up and left the room, went into the
      kitchen which lay beyond the printing-room, and returned with two tumblers
      and a jug of water. Gallagher looked up from his writing for an instant.
      Doyle noticed with pleasure the expression of violent anger was fading
      from his eyes. Michael Antony, who was a brisk and willing boy, returned
      with a bottle rather more than half full of whisky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary Ellen was upstairs along with a lady,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But I found the
      bottle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you were three years older,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d give you a drop for your
      trouble. But it wouldn&rsquo;t be good for you, Michael Antony, and your mother
      wouldn&rsquo;t be pleased if she heard you were taking it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have the pledge since Christmas, anyway,&rdquo; said Michael Antony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thady,&rdquo; said Doyle, when the boy had left the room, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a drink you
      want to quench the rage that&rsquo;s in you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gallagher looked up from his papers. He did not say anything, but Doyle
      understood exactly what he would have said if his pride had not prevented
      him from speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The width of two fingers in the bottom of the tumbler,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;with
      as much water on top of that as would leave you free to say that you
      weren&rsquo;t drinking it plain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The amount of water necessary to soothe Gallagher&rsquo;s conscience was very
      small. Doyle added it from the jug in driblets of about a teaspoonful at a
      time. At the sound of the third splash Gallagher raised his hand. Doyle
      laid down the jug at once. Gallagher, without looking up from his papers,
      stretched out his left hand and felt about until he grasped the tumbler.
      He raised it to his lips and took a mouthful of whisky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thady,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve no great liking for Mr. Ford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not,&rdquo; said Gallagher. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he always going against me at the
      Petty Sessions, he and the old Major together, and treating me as if I
      wasn&rsquo;t a magistrate the same as the best of them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He does that, and it&rsquo;s a crying shame, so it is, that he&rsquo;s allowed to;
      but sure that&rsquo;s the way things are in this country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gallagher took another gulp of whisky and waited. Doyle said nothing more.
      He appeared to have nothing more to say and to have mentioned Mr. Ford&rsquo;s
      name merely for the sake of making conversation. But Gallagher wished to
      develop the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about Mr. Ford?&rdquo; he said, after a long silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s terrible down on the erection of the statue to General John Regan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m that myself,&rdquo; said Gallagher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Ford will be pleased when he hears it; for there&rsquo;ll be no statue if
      you set your face against it. It&rsquo;ll be then that Mr. Ford will be proud of
      himself. He&rsquo;ll be saying all round the Country that it was him put a stop
      to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will not be him that put a stop to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;ll say, anyway,&rdquo; said Doyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gallagher finished his whisky in two large gulps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have another drop,&rdquo; said Doyle. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s doing you good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gallagher pushed his tumbler across the table. Doyle replenished it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be sorry,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;if Mr. Ford was to be able to say he&rsquo;d got
      the better of you, Thady, in a matter of the kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll not be me he&rsquo;ll get the better of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll say it,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;and what&rsquo;s more there&rsquo;s them that will
      believe it. For they&rsquo;ll say, recollecting the speech you made on Tuesday,
      that you were in favour of the statue, and that only for Mr. Ford you&rsquo;d
      have had it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I thought that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; said Gallagher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along over now to the committee,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll have the
      statue just in derision of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t the statue that I&rsquo;m objecting to,&rdquo; said Gallagher, &ldquo;nor it isn&rsquo;t
      the notion of a new pier. You know that, Doyle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if it&rsquo;s the wish of the people of this locality that there should be
      a statue&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the wish,&rdquo; said Doyle. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you say yourself that the people was
      unanimous about it after the meeting in the market square?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gallagher rose from his chair and pushed his papers back on the table. He
      crushed his soft hat down on the back of his head and turned to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew well,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;that you&rsquo;d do whatever was right in the latter
      end. And as for the tune that was troubling you, it&rsquo;s even money that the
      band will never play it. Father McCormack was telling me yesterday that
      the big drum&rsquo;s broke on them on account of one of the boys giving it a
      kind of a slit with the point of a knife. The band will hardly ever be
      able to play that tune or any other tune when they haven&rsquo;t got a big
      drum.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Major Kent passed through the narrow hall of the hotel, went up a flight
      of stairs and entered the commercial room. Mary Ellen was on her hands and
      knees under the table which stood in the middle of the room. She was
      collecting the corks which had offended Doyle&rsquo;s eye. There were more than
      three of them. She had four in her left hand, and was stretching out to
      grasp two more when the Major entered the room. As soon as she saw him she
      abandoned the pursuit of the corks, crept out from underneath the table,
      and stood looking at the Major. She expected him to order a drink of some
      sort. Most people who entered Doyle&rsquo;s commercial room ordered drinks. The
      Major was slightly embarrassed. Mary Ellen evidently expected him to say
      something to her, and he did not know what to say. He did not want a
      drink, and he could not think of any subject of conversation likely to
      interest a tousled girl who had just been crawling about the floor on her
      hands and knees. At last he said &ldquo;Good morning.&rdquo; Mary Ellen gaped at him
      and then smiled. The Major, recollecting that it was half-past one
      o&rsquo;clock, and therefore no longer morning, said that it was a fine evening.
      Mary Ellen&rsquo;s smile broadened. The Major expressed a polite hope that she
      was quite well. He thought of shaking hands with her, and wished that he
      had brought a pair of gloves with him, Mary Ellen&rsquo;s hands were certainly
      dirty and they looked hot. But he was not obliged to shake hands. Mary
      Ellen realised that he was a kind of man new to her, one who did not want
      a drink. She left the room, came back again almost at once for the broom
      which she had forgotten, and then left decisively, slamming the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major crossed the room and looked out of the window. He saw Doyle and
      Gallagher go into Kerrigan&rsquo;s shop, and wondered vaguely what they wanted
      there. He saw Constable Moriarty telling a story, evidently of a humorous
      kind, to Sergeant Colgan, at the door of the police barrack. The story&mdash;he
      judged from Moriarty&rsquo;s gestures&mdash;had something to do with Doyle and
      Gallagher. He wondered, without much real interest, what the story was.
      There was nothing else of an exciting kind to be seen from the window. The
      Major turned and walked to the opposite corner of the room. He stood in
      front of a small square mahogany table. On it was a stuffed fox in a glass
      case. The Major looked at it carefully from several points of view. It was
      a very ordinary fox, and appeared to have been stuffed a long time. Moths
      had eaten the fur off its back in several places, and one of its eyes,
      which were made of bright brown beads, was hanging from the socket by a
      thread. The glass of the case was exceedingly dusty. The Major, finding
      the fox dull and rather disgusting, left it and went over to the
      fireplace. Over the chimney piece hung a portrait of a very self-satisfied
      priest who looked as if he had just dined well. A gold Latin cross,
      attached to a black ribbon watch guard, rested gracefully on the large
      stomach of the man. The stomach struck the Major as one which was usually
      distended to its utmost capacity. The portrait was remarkable for that
      fuzziness of outline which seems to be inevitable in enlarged photographs.
      The frame was a very handsome one, elaborately carved and gilt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next the picture of the priest, unframed and attached to the wall with
      tacks, was a large coloured supplement, taken from an American paper. It
      presented a famous boxer stripped to the waist in the act of shaking hands
      with a dejected-looking opponent. Underneath his large picture was a list
      of the boxer&rsquo;s most famous conflicts, with date and a note of the number
      of rounds which each victim had survived. Round the central picture were
      twelve small ones, in which the hero appeared in the act of felling other
      fighters, not so heroic or less muscular. The Major, who had done some
      boxing in his day, looked at the picture with critical interest. Then
      Father McCormack entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in good time after all,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I was afraid, maybe, the meeting
      might be over when I saw Doyle and Thady Gallagher going into the office
      of the <i>Connacht Eagle</i> after leaving Kerrigan&rsquo;s shop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re time enough,&rdquo; said the Major. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re not more than
      half-an-hour late it&rsquo;s time enough for any meeting that&rsquo;s held in this
      town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true too,&rdquo; said Father McCormack. &ldquo;As a general rule that&rsquo;s true
      enough. But I&rsquo;ve known meetings that was over and done with before the
      time when they ought to be beginning. That would be when there might be
      something to be done at them that some of the members would be objecting
      to if they were there. I&rsquo;ve known that happen, and I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if
      you&rsquo;d been caught that way yourself before now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far as I know,&rdquo; said the Major, &ldquo;nothing of the sort has happened this
      time. There&rsquo;s no reason why it should. When anything as silly as this
      statue business is on hand everybody is sure to be unanimously in favour
      of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true enough. But where&rsquo;s the rest of the committee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody has turned up so far, except myself,&rdquo; said the Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Father McCormack, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m as well pleased. To tell you the
      truth, Major, I&rsquo;m glad of the chance of a few minutes quiet talk with you
      while we have the place to ourselves. I thought it my duty, and you&rsquo;ll
      understand me that I&rsquo;m not casting reflections on you nor yet on the
      doctor, and I&rsquo;d be sorry to say a word against Doyle, or for the matter of
      that against Thady Gallagher, though it would be better if he had more
      sense. But anyway, I thought it my duty to acquaint the bishop with what
      was going on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The statue idea?&rdquo; said the Major. &ldquo;Well, what did he say? I don&rsquo;t know
      your bishop personally, but I suppose a man could hardly be in his
      position if he was altogether a fool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe me or not as you like,&rdquo; said Father Mc-Cormack, &ldquo;but when I got
      the bishop&rsquo;s answer to my letter, it turned out that he knew no more than
      myself about General John Regan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t surprise me in the least. I don&rsquo;t believe any one knows who
      he was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the bishop said was that it might look queer if I was to take no
      part in the proceedings when the Lord-Lieutenant was coming to unveil the
      statue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That puts you in a safe position anyhow,&rdquo; said the Major. &ldquo;If it turns
      out afterwards that there is anything fishy about the General, the bishop
      and the Lord-Lieutenant will have to share the blame between them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I want to know from you,&rdquo; said Father Mc-Cormack, &ldquo;is this: Is the
      Lord-Lieutenant coming or is he not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only got the doctor&rsquo;s word for it. He says he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The doctor&rsquo;s a fine man, and there&rsquo;s not many things he&rsquo;d set his hand to
      but he&rsquo;d carry them through at the latter end. But the Lord-Lieutenant!
      The Lord-Lieutenant is&mdash;well now, do you think it likely that the
      Lord-Lieutenant is coming down here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the least likely,&rdquo; said the Major, &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s nothing about
      this whole business that is. It isn&rsquo;t likely in my opinion that there was
      such a person as General John Regan. It wasn&rsquo;t likely beforehand that we&rsquo;d
      subscribe to put up a statue to him. I don&rsquo;t see that the Lord-Lieutenant
      is any more unlikely than lots of other things that have happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear you say that,&rdquo; said Father McCormack.
    </p>
    <p>
      He and Major Kent were standing together at the window while they talked.
      Neither of them noticed that Mary Ellen had come into the room. She stood
      for some time near the door, hoping that either the Major or Father
      McCormack would look round. Neither of them did, so she sidled slowly into
      the room and stood beside the stuffed fox. She was a very well mannered
      girl, and most unwilling to interrupt an earnest, possibly an important
      conversation. When Father McCormack made his last remark she felt that her
      chance had come. It was evident from the tone in which he spoke, that he
      and the Major had reached a more or less satisfactory conclusion of their
      business, She coughed, and then tapped lightly with her knuckles on the
      glass case of the stuffed fox. Both Father McCormack and the Major looked
      round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lady below,&rdquo; said Mary Ellen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lady!&rdquo; said Major Kent. &ldquo;Surely to goodness we&rsquo;re not going to have
      women on this committee. Things are bad enough without that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo; said Father Mctormack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Mrs. Gregg,&rdquo; said Mary Ellen, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s the doctor she&rsquo;s asking
      for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The doctor&rsquo;s not here,&rdquo; said Father McCormack. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see that for
      yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s Mrs. Gregg,&rdquo; said the Major, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d better show her up. You can&rsquo;t
      leave her standing by herself in the hall till the doctor chooses to come.
      I wish to goodness he would come. I can&rsquo;t think why he isn&rsquo;t here. This is
      his show entirely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gregg came into the room while the Major was speaking. She looked
      agitated and, in spite of the fact that she had been waiting downstairs
      for nearly ten minutes, was almost breathless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Major Kent,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;where&rsquo;s Dr. O&rsquo;Grady? Such a dreadful thing
      has happened. I don&rsquo;t know what to do. Just fancy&mdash;Mrs. Ford has
      written to me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no use appealing to me,&rdquo; said the Major. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do anything
      with Mrs. Ford. She and I are hardly on speaking terms. It&rsquo;s not my fault&mdash;at
      least I don&rsquo;t think it is&mdash;but you must see Mrs. Gregg, that I can&rsquo;t
      interfere about any letter she may have written to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gregg shook hands with Father McCormack, but her head was turned away
      from him as she did so. She had little hope that he could interfere
      effectually to settle the difficulty created by Mrs. Ford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. O&rsquo;Grady said that I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Major interrupted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d far better wait till the doctor comes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be here in
      a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t wait. Mrs. Ford is down at the dress-maker&rsquo;s now. It&rsquo;ll be
      too late if I wait. What am I to do? It will spoil the whole thing if Mrs.
      Ford insists&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. O&rsquo;Grady came in. He was whistling cheerfully, not &ldquo;Rule, Britannia,&rdquo;
       but a harmless Irish jig.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You here, Major. Good. And Father McCormack. There&rsquo;s
      nothing like punctuality. And Mrs. Gregg. How do you do, Mrs. Gregg?
      Everything going on all right about Mary Ellen&rsquo;s costume?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, it isn&rsquo;t. But I&rsquo;m so glad you&rsquo;ve come. Mrs. Ford&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me one moment, Mrs. Gregg,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;I just want to ask
      Father McCormack one question. Listen now, Father McCormack. Do you know
      this tune?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He began to whistle &ldquo;Rule, Britannia.&rdquo; When he was about half way through
      Mrs. Gregg interrupted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gregg. &ldquo;I really can&rsquo;t. Mrs. Ford is at the
      dressmaker&rsquo;s and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll attend to that in one minute, Mrs. Gregg. But I must get Father
      McCormack&rsquo;s opinion on this tune first. Doyle and Gallagher may arrive at
      any moment, and then I shan&rsquo;t be able to go into the question. Now Father
      McCormack, do you recognise the tune I whistled you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard it,&rdquo; said Father McCormack, &ldquo;and to the best of my belief it
      was at a military tournament up in Dublin last year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s &lsquo;Rule, Britannia,&rsquo;&rdquo; said the Major. &ldquo;And if it&rsquo;s played in this town
      there&rsquo;ll be a row.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There might be,&rdquo; said Father McCormack, &ldquo;if Thady Gallagher knows what
      tune it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t know yourself, Father McCormack,
      and if you didn&rsquo;t I&rsquo;m quite satisfied that Thady Gallagher won&rsquo;t. We can
      count on your keeping your mouth shut, Major, I suppose. Now, Mrs. Gregg,
      what has Mrs. Ford been doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She says,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gregg, &ldquo;that Mary Ellen is to wear a plain dark grey
      tweed dress, and I had it all planned out&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;White muslin,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;with a silk slip. I remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;d look perfectly sweet,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gregg, &ldquo;and I took her to the
      dressmaker yesterday evening just as you told me. I had the whole thing
      arranged. She was to have a blue sash.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was,&rdquo; said Mary Ellen, who was still standing beside the stuffed fox.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Mrs. Ford agreed at the time,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gregg, &ldquo;and now I&rsquo;ve just
      got a note from her saying that a dark grey tweed would be much more
      suitable because it would be useful afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;that you haven&rsquo;t managed this
      business quite as tactfully as I expected you would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Ford said she was going straight to the dress-maker to order the
      grey tweed. She&rsquo;s there now, most likely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gregg&rsquo;s voice had a break in it. It seemed to Dr. O&rsquo;Grady that she
      was on the verge of tears. He turned to Mary Ellen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which would you rather have, Mary Ellen, a white muslin frock, or a grey
      tweed, one that would be useful to you afterwards? Don&rsquo;t be in a hurry to
      decide. Think it well over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary Ellen seemed very well inclined to take this advice. She stood quite
      silent with one of her fingers pressed against the corner of her mouth.
      She was thinking deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear to have everything I settled upset by that woman,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Gregg. &ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d never made me ask her to help. I wish I&rsquo;d never&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We had to keep her in a good temper,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll not be able to do that,&rdquo; said the Major, &ldquo;nobody could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing but spite makes her do it,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gregg. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just
      because I&rsquo;m presenting a bouquet and she&rsquo;s not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hang it all!&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be that. I told her distinctly
      that she&rsquo;d be allowed to hand over the illuminated address. What more can
      she want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all spite and jealousy,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gregg, &ldquo;and Mary Ellen will look
      perfectly hideous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary Ellen,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;have you made up your mind yet which of
      those two dresses you&rsquo;d like?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have,&rdquo; said Mary Ellen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;d like the white muslin, of course,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gregg. &ldquo;No girl would
      choose&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like the both of them,&rdquo; said Mary Ellen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall have them,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the best way I see out of
      the difficulty. Mrs. Gregg, you get the dress you want for her, privately,
      without saying a word about it. Agree with everything Mrs. Ford says, and
      let her order a red flannel petticoat if she likes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But which will she wear?&rdquo; said Mrs. Gregg, &ldquo;for if she&rsquo;s to be dressed in
      a ridiculous stuffy grey tweed&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll wear your one, of course,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll put it on and
      stand in the middle of the square just underneath the statue. There&rsquo;ll be
      a large crowd of people, and it will be too late for Mrs. Ford to do
      anything. She can&rsquo;t change the girl&rsquo;s clothes in the street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t count on any delicacy of feeling in Mrs. Ford,&rdquo; said the Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And will I have the both of the dresses after?&rdquo; said Mary Ellen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;unless Mrs. Ford manages to drag the grey
      tweed one away from you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be furious,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gregg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She may be as furious as she likes then,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;She won&rsquo;t be
      able to show it while the Lord-Lieutenant&rsquo;s wife is shaking hands with her
      out of the motor-car, and it won&rsquo;t matter to us what she does afterwards.
      The only thing we have to be careful about is to keep her in a good temper&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; said the Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In as good a temper as possible between this and then. And now, Mrs.
      Gregg, if you&rsquo;ll excuse my saying so, I think you and Mary Ellen had
      better trot off to the dressmaker. If any further difficulty arises refer
      to me at once. But I don&rsquo;t see how anything can. All you&rsquo;ve got to do is
      to let Mrs. Ford have her own way, and give your orders when she&rsquo;s gone
      home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gregg did not seem entirely satisfied with this settlement of her
      difficulty, but she and Mary Ellen went off together to meet Mrs. Ford at
      the dressmaker&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Women,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;are the devil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was not much better satisfied than Mrs. Gregg was with his new plan. He
      foresaw very serious difficulties in carrying it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve no one but yourself to thank for all this bother!&rdquo; said the Major.
      &ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t the slightest necessity to have Mary Ellen in the affair at
      all, dressed or undressed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. O&rsquo;Grady was not listening to a word the Major said. He was thinking
      deeply. His face lightened suddenly and he rushed across the room to the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Gregg!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Mrs. Gregg! Just one moment. I&rsquo;ve got a capital
      suggestion to make, one to which there can be no possible objection from
      any point of view.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He ran downstairs. Father McCormack went to the door and looked after him.
      Then he turned and addressed the Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might go a long journey,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;before you&rsquo;d meet the equal of
      the doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Major received this remark in silence. He was of opinion that a man
      who went a long journey in order to discover a second Dr. O&rsquo;Grady would be
      a fool.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me this,&rdquo; said Father McCormack. &ldquo;What relation is Mary Ellen to the
      General?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been able to make that out for certain. Sometimes I&rsquo;m told
      she&rsquo;s his niece, and sometimes his grand-niece.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father McCormack looked round him cautiously and sank his voice to a
      whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she any relation at all?&rdquo; he said slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more than you are to the Sultan of Turkey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was thinking as much myself,&rdquo; said Father McCormack.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, having finished his talk with Mrs. Gregg, entered the room
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve settled that matter satisfactorily anyhow,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It occurred to
      me just after Mrs. Gregg had left the room, that some sort of fancy dress
      for the girl would be likely to please the Lord-Lieutenant, and would be a
      compromise which both ladies could accept without loss of dignity. Mary
      Ellen is to be rigged out as a traditional Irish colleen, the sort you see
      on the picture postcards they sell to tourists in Dublin. Mrs. Gregg is
      delighted, and Mrs. Ford can&rsquo;t possibly say that a crimson flannel skirt
      won&rsquo;t be useful to her afterwards. She&rsquo;ll look uncommonly well, and the
      Lord-Lieutenant will be all the more inclined to believe that the General
      was an Irishman when he sees his niece&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me this,&rdquo; said Father McCormack, &ldquo;is she a niece of the General or
      is she not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The grand-niece,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s neither the one nor the other,&rdquo; said the Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. O&rsquo;Grady glanced at Father McCormack. He saw by the look on the
      priest&rsquo;s face that there was no use trying to prove Mary Ellen&rsquo;s
      relationship. He laughed good-naturedly, and at once offered a
      satisfactory explanation of the position.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Billing,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;insisted on our producing some sort of relative
      for the dead General. He wouldn&rsquo;t have given that £100 if we hadn&rsquo;t. Now
      what I say is this&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d say anything,&rdquo; said the Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not talking to you now, Major. I&rsquo;m talking to Father McCormack, who&rsquo;s
      a man of sense, with some knowledge of the world. The way I&rsquo;m putting it
      to him is this: Supposing there was a job going a begging, a nice
      comfortable job under the Government, with no particular duties attached
      to it, except just to look pleasant and be generally agreeable&mdash;there
      are such jobs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plenty, plenty,&rdquo; said Father McCormack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they&rsquo;re well paid,&rdquo; said the Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And supposing that you were asked to nominate a man for the post&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       Dr. O&rsquo;Grady still addressed himself only to Father McCormack. &ldquo;You might
      be, you know. In fact you, and other people in your position often are,
      though there&rsquo;s always supposed to be a competitive examination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody believes in examinations,&rdquo; said the Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what I&rsquo;m saying,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;Now what would you do
      in a case of the kind? As a matter of fact what do you do? What did you do
      when they were appointing a secretary to the Old-Age Pension Committee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d look out for some decent poor fellow,&rdquo; said Father McCormack. &ldquo;One
      that might be wanting something of the kind, a man that nobody would have
      anything particular to say against.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t spend a lot of time arguing about whether there ought to be
      such a secretary or not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would not, of course,&rdquo; said Father McCormack. &ldquo;What would be the use?
      If the job&rsquo;s there and a man&rsquo;s wanted I&rsquo;d have no business talking about
      the rights or wrongs of it beyond saying that the salary ought to be a bit
      larger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;Now that&rsquo;s just what&rsquo;s happened in this
      case. It isn&rsquo;t exactly a job, under the Government, not under our
      Government, though it may lead on to something in Bolivia. Here&rsquo;s a dead
      General that has to be fitted out with a niece&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said a grand-niece a minute ago,&rdquo; said the Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The principle&rsquo;s the same,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;What I&rsquo;m trying to get you
      to see is that Mary Ellen may just as well step into the position as
      anyone else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you put it that way,&rdquo; said Father McCor-mack, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no more to be
      said. The girl&rsquo;s a decent girl, and I wouldn&rsquo;t stand in the way of her
      bettering herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be the better by a new dress, anyway!&rdquo; said the Major. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      know that she&rsquo;ll benefit in any other way. But that&rsquo;s something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I rather think,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;that I hear Doyle downstairs. We&rsquo;ll
      be able to get on with the business of the committee now, whether he has
      Thady with him or not. We&rsquo;ve wasted time enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll waste a lot more before we&rsquo;ve done,&rdquo; said the Major. &ldquo;The whole
      thing&rsquo;s waste of time. There&rsquo;ll never be a statue in Ballymoy either to
      General John Regan or to anyone else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. O&rsquo;Grady had drawn a bundle of papers from his pocket and laid them on
      the table before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our first business, gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is to settle about the
      illuminated address which Mrs. Ford has kindly consented to present to the
      Lord-Lieutenant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thady Gallagher glared at Dr. O&rsquo;Grady savagely. He did not like being
      interrupted in the middle of a speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Order, gentlemen, order,&rdquo; said Father McCor-mack, nervously tapping the
      table with his pencil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With regard to the illuminated address,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m of opinion that
      the carrying out of it should be given into the hands of a Dublin firm.
      It&rsquo;s our duty to support Irish manufacture. There&rsquo;s too much money sent
      over to England that might be far better kept at home. You&rsquo;ll agree with
      me there, Thady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to say in the address?&rdquo; said the Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the usual things,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we need go into
      that in detail. All addresses are pretty much the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t sign my name to anything political,&rdquo; said the Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m with you there,&rdquo; said Father McCormack. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of the curses of
      this country the way politics are dragged into business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody wants politics,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;The address will contain
      nothing but nice little compliments to the Lord-Lieutenant with a word or
      two about the value of piers put in at the end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the matter&rsquo;s left in the hands of the firm I have in mind,&rdquo; said
      Doyle, &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll be done right. They&rsquo;ve illuminated three-quarters of the
      addresses that have been presented in the country, and whether it&rsquo;s a bank
      manager or a priest going on a new mission, or a Lord-Lieutenant that the
      address is for, the firm I mean will know what to put into it. They&rsquo;ve had
      the experience, and experience is what is wanted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll give him names and dates,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;and tell him that
      this is a seaport town with no proper pier. With that information any fool
      could draw up the text of an illuminated address. I propose that the
      matter be left in the hands of a subcommittee consisting of Mr. Doyle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you all agreed on that, gentlemen?&rdquo; said Father McCormack.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thady Gallagher rose slowly to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With regard to what Mr. Doyle has just laid before the meeting,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;and speaking of the duty of supporting Irish manufacture, I&rsquo;m of opinion
      that his words do him credit. I&rsquo;m an out and out supporter of the
      Industrial Revival, and when I look round about me on the ruined mills
      that once were hives of industry, and the stream of emigration which is
      flowing from our shores year after year&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we need spend much time discussing the bouquet,&rdquo; said Dr.
      O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll have to be ordered from Dublin too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no flowers here to make a bouquet of,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;unless,
      maybe, the Major&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a few Sweet-Williams,&rdquo; said the Major, &ldquo;and a bed of mixed stocks.
      If you think they&rsquo;d be any use to you you&rsquo;re welcome to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We might do worse,&rdquo; said Father McCormack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to do better,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t offer a lady in
      the position of a Lord-Lieutenant&rsquo;s wife a bundle of ordinary stocks! What
      we have to get is lilies and roses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only right that we should,&rdquo; said Father McCormack, &ldquo;but I think the
      thanks of the meeting ought to be given to Major Kent for his generous
      offer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I second that,&rdquo; said Doyle. &ldquo;The Major was always a good friend to
      anything that might be for the benefit of the town or the locality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ordering of the bouquet,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;to be left to the same
      sub-committee which has charge of the address.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it to be sent to the hotel here,&rdquo; said Father McCormack, &ldquo;on the
      morning of the ceremony, so as it will be fresh. Are you all agreed on
      that, gentlemen? What&rsquo;s the next business, doctor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The next business is the statue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the date of the Lord-Lieutenant&rsquo;s visit?&rdquo; said the Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thursday week,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s ten days from to-day,&rdquo; said the Major. &ldquo;We may just as well go
      home at once as sit here talking to each other. There&rsquo;s no time to get a
      statue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do our business before we stir,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of saying things like that?&rdquo; said the Major. &ldquo;You know
      jolly well, O&rsquo;Grady, that you can&rsquo;t get a statue in ten days. The thing&rsquo;s
      impossible. It takes a year at least to make a statue of any size. You
      can&rsquo;t go into a shop and buy a statue, as if it were a hat or an
      umbrella.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a good deal in what the Major says,&rdquo; said Father McCormack. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      inclined to agree with him. I remember well when they were putting up the
      monument to Parnell in Dublin it took them years before they had it
      finished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good job for everybody concerned,&rdquo; said the Major, &ldquo;that we&rsquo;re
      brought up short. We&rsquo;d simply have made ourselves publicly ridiculous if
      we&rsquo;d gone on with this business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Major, Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, and Doyle, spoke when they did speak, in an easy
      conversational tone without rising from their chairs. But this was not
      Gallagher&rsquo;s idea of the proper way of conducting public business. He
      believed that important discussions ought to be carried on with dignity.
      When he spoke he stood up and addressed the committee as if he were taking
      part in a political demonstration, using appropriate gestures to emphasize
      his words. The difficulty about the statue gave him a great opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I stand here to-day,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;as the representative of the people of
      this locality, and what I&rsquo;m going to say now I&rsquo;d say if the police spies
      of Dublin Castle was standing round me taking down the words I utter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Young Kerrigan had been obliged to stop practising &ldquo;Rule, Britannia&rdquo; on
      the cornet in order to eat his dinner. When he had satisfied his appetite
      and soothed his nerves with a pipe of tobacco he set to work at the tune
      again. The hour&rsquo;s rest had not helped him in any way. He made exactly the
      same mistake as he had been making all the morning. It happened that he
      took up his cornet again shortly before Gallagher began his speech in
      which he declared himself a representative of the people of the locality.
      The noise of the music floated through the open window of the committee
      room. It had a slightly exasperating effect on Gallagher, but he went on
      speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I say is this,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s what I always will say. If it is
      the unanimous wish of the people of this locality to erect a statue to the
      memory of the great patriot, who is gone, then a statue ought to be
      erected. If the Major is right&mdash;and he may be right&mdash;in saying
      that it takes a year to make a statue, then we&rsquo;ll take a year. We&rsquo;ll take
      ten years if necessary. Please God the most of us has years enough before
      us yet to spare that many for a good work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Young Kerrigan continued to break down at the &ldquo;never, never, never,&rdquo; part
      of the tune. Dr. O&rsquo;Grady began to fidget nervously in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, Thady,&rdquo; said Doyle. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know that if we postpone the
      statue we&rsquo;ll never get the Lord-Lieutenant to open it? Didn&rsquo;t he say in
      his letter that Thursday week was the only day he could come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for the so-called Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland,&rdquo; said Gallagher, waving
      his arm in the air, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve done without him and the likes of him up to
      this, and we&rsquo;re well able to do without him for the future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He brought his fist down with tremendous force as he spoke, striking the
      table with the pad of flesh underneath his little finger. Dr. O&rsquo;Grady
      jumped up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me one moment, gentlemen,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That young fool, Kerrigan, is
      getting the tune wrong every time, and if I don&rsquo;t stop him he&rsquo;ll never get
      it right at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He walked across to the window as he spoke and looked out. Then he turned
      round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let me interfere with your speech, Thady,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m listening
      all right, and I&rsquo;m sure Father McCormack and the rest of the committee
      want to hear every word of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Gallagher, in spite of this encouragement, did not seem inclined to go
      on. He sat down and scowled ferociously at Doyle. Dr. O&rsquo;Grady put his head
      out of the window and shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Moriarty,&rdquo; he called, &ldquo;Constable Moriarty, come over here for a minute
      and stop grinning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he drew in his head and turned round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Major,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a magistrate. I wish to goodness you&rsquo;d give
      orders that Moriarty isn&rsquo;t to grin in that offensive way. It&rsquo;s a danger to
      the public peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t do anything of the sort,&rdquo; said the Major. &ldquo;In the first place I
      can&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ve no authority over the police. They are Gregg&rsquo;s business. In
      the second place&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped at this point because Dr. O&rsquo;Grady was not listening to him. He
      had stretched his head and shoulders out of the window and was talking in
      a very loud tone to Moriarty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run over,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and tell young Kerrigan to come here to me for a
      minute. When you&rsquo;ve done that go to bed or dig potatoes or do any other
      mortal thing except stand at the door of the barrack grinning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What tune&rsquo;s that young Kerrigan&rsquo;s after playing?&rdquo; said Gallagher
      solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father McCormack looked anxiously at Major Kent. The Major fixed his eyes
      on the stuffed fox in the glass case. It was Doyle who answered Gallagher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no tune at all the way he&rsquo;s playing it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you hear
      the doctor saying he had it wrong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What tune would it be,&rdquo; said Gallagher, &ldquo;if so be he had it right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you before,&rdquo; said Doyle. &ldquo;I told you till I&rsquo;m tired telling you
      that I don&rsquo;t know the name of it. It&rsquo;s not a tune that ever I heard
      before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find out what tune it is,&rdquo; said Gallagher savagely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll drag it
      out of you if I have to drag the black liver of you along with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Order, gentlemen, order,&rdquo; said Father McCormack. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s no language to
      be using here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was meaning no disrespect to you, Father,&rdquo; said Gallagher. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be the
      last man in Ireland to raise my hand against the clergy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the doctor&rsquo;s liver you&rsquo;ll have to drag, Thady, if you drag any liver
      at all,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;for he&rsquo;s the only one that knows what the tune is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Moriarty appeared to have conveyed the message to young Kerrigan. Dr.
      O&rsquo;Grady, still leaning out of the window, spoke again, this time evidently
      to Kerrigan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;ts you know you&rsquo;re getting it wrong every time?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Kerrigan&rsquo;s voice, faint and apologetic, reached the members of the
      committee through the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure I know that well enough; but the devil&rsquo;s in it that I can&rsquo;t get it
      right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me now,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady.
    </p>
    <p>
      He whistled the tune shrilly, beating time with his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Kerrigan,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;try it after me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He whistled it again slowly. Kerrigan followed him note by note on the
      cornet. After a very short hesitation he got over the difficult passage.
      Dr. O&rsquo;Grady drew in his head and returned to the table with a sigh of
      relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he has it now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s a tough job teaching that
      fellow anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What tune is it?&rdquo; said Gallagher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a tune that ever you heard before,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m of opinion that I did hear it,&rdquo; said Gallagher. &ldquo;But let you speak
      out now if you&rsquo;re not ashamed of it, and tell me what tune it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the &lsquo;Battle March of King Malachi the Brave,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady,
      &ldquo;the same that he played when he was driving the English out of Ireland.
      And you can&rsquo;t possibly have heard it before because the manuscript of it
      was only dug up the other day at Tara, and this is the first time it&rsquo;s
      ever been played publicly in the west of Ireland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There now, Thady,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t I tell you all along that you&rsquo;d
      nothing to do only to ask the doctor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m of opinion that I did hear it,&rdquo; said Gallagher. &ldquo;You may say what you
      like about the Hill of Tara, but I&rsquo;ve heard that tune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just possible,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;that Mr. Billing may have
      whistled it while he was here. I believe the people of Bolivia are fond of
      it. They learned it, of course, from General John Regan. He may have heard
      it from his grandmother. It&rsquo;s wonderful how long music survives among the
      people long after the regular professional musicians have forgotten all
      about it. But I mustn&rsquo;t interrupt you any more, Thady. You were just
      making a speech about the Lord-Lieutenant. Perhaps you have finished what
      you were saying. As well as I recollect we were just settling about the
      statue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Major Kent was after saying,&rdquo; said Father McCor-mack, &ldquo;that we couldn&rsquo;t
      get a statue in the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend Mr. Doyle,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;has a proposal to lay before the
      meeting. Where&rsquo;s that card, Doyle, that you showed me last week?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doyle drew a bundle of grimy papers from his breast pocket and went
      through them slowly. One, which appeared to be a letter written on
      business paper, he laid on the table in front of him. At the bottom of the
      bundle he came on a large card. He handed this to Father McCormack. The
      printing on it was done in Curiously shaped letters, evidently artistic in
      intention, with a tendency towards the ecclesiastical. Round the outside
      of the card was a deep border of black, as if the owner of it were in
      mourning for a near relative.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father McCormack looked at it dubiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read it out,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like the Major to hear exactly
      what&rsquo;s on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Mr. Aloysius Doyle,&rsquo;&rdquo; read Father McCormack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a nephew of my own,&rdquo; said Doyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He would be,&rdquo; said Gallagher. &ldquo;If he wasn&rsquo;t we&rsquo;d hear nothing about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was still feeling sore about the &ldquo;Battle March of King Malachi the
      Brave,&rdquo; and was anxious to make himself disagreeable to someone. It struck
      him that it would be easy to annoy Doyle by suggesting that he was trying
      to do a good turn to his nephew at the expense of the statue fund.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I needn&rsquo;t tell you, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Doyle, with great dignity, &ldquo;that
      it&rsquo;s not on account of his being a nephew of my own that I&rsquo;m recommending
      him to the notice of this committee. If he was fifty times my nephew I
      wouldn&rsquo;t mention his name without I was sure that he was as good a man as
      any other for the job we have on hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No one, of course, believed this, but no one wanted to argue with Doyle
      about it. Father McCormack went on reading from the black-edged card which
      he held in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Mortuary Sculptor,&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sculptor!&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;You hear that, Major, don&rsquo;t you? Sculptors
      are people who make statues.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mortuary sculptors, I suppose,&rdquo; said the Major viciously, &ldquo;make statues
      of dead men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The General&rsquo;s dead anyway,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;so that&rsquo;s suitable enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Address&mdash;The Monumental Studio, Michael Angelo House, Great
      Brunswick. Street, Dublin,&rsquo;&rdquo; read Father McCormack. &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be where your
      nephew lives, Mr. Doyle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s where he has his works,&rdquo; said Doyle. &ldquo;He lives down near
      Sandymount.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Celtic Crosses, Obelisks and every kind of Monument supplied at the
      shortest notice,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Father McCormack, still reading from the card.
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Family Vaults decorated. Inscriptions Cut. Estimates Free. Low Prices&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that we could possibly do better than that,&rdquo; said Dr.
      O&rsquo;Grady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even Doyle&rsquo;s nephew can&rsquo;t make a statue in ten days,&rdquo; said the Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says &lsquo;shortest notice&rsquo; on his card. You ought to believe the man,
      Major, until you&rsquo;ve some evidence that he&rsquo;s a liar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what he says,&rdquo; said the Major. &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t make a statue in
      ten days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get to that point in a minute,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;The first thing
      we have to decide is whether Mr. Aloysius Doyle is a suitable man to be
      entrusted with the work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no other tenders before us,&rdquo; said Father McCormack, &ldquo;so I suppose
      we may as well&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse my interrupting you, Father,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;but before you take the
      opinion of the meeting on this point, I&rsquo;d like to say that I&rsquo;m offering no
      opinion one way or the other; and what&rsquo;s more I won&rsquo;t give a vote either
      for or against. I wouldn&rsquo;t like to do it in a case where my own nephew is
      a candidate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t tell us that, Mr. Doyle,&rdquo; said Father McCormack. &ldquo;We all know
      that you&rsquo;re not the kind of man who&rsquo;d be using his public position to
      further the interests of his relatives. What do you say now, gentlemen? Is
      Mr. Aloysius Doyle to be given the contract for the statue or not? What do
      you say, Major?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he can make a full-sized statue of a General in ten days,&rdquo; said the
      Major, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s a man who deserves every encouragement we can give him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, doctor,&rdquo; said Father McCormack, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s your opinion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m for giving him the job,&rdquo; said the Doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Doyle won&rsquo;t vote,&rdquo; said Father McCormack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not,&rdquo; said Doyle firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So we&rsquo;d be glad of your opinion, Mr. Gallagher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If his price is satisfactory,&rdquo; said Gallagher, &ldquo;we may as well give him
      the preference. I&rsquo;d be in favour of supporting local talent when possible,
      and although Mr. Aloysius Doyle isn&rsquo;t a resident among us at present, his
      family belongs to Ballymoy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carried unanimously,&rdquo; said Father McCormack. &ldquo;And now about the price.
      What will that nephew of yours do us a statue for, Doyle? And mind you, it
      must be done well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before we go into that,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like the committee to
      hear a letter which Mr. Doyle has received from his nephew. I thought it
      well, considering how short the time at our disposal is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten days,&rdquo; said the Major. &ldquo;Ten days to make a statue&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The letter which we are just going to read,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;will meet
      the Major&rsquo;s difficulty. I thought it well to get into communication with
      Mr. Aloysius Doyle at once so as to have everything ready for the
      committee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder you haven&rsquo;t the statue ready,&rdquo; said the Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wrote to him, or rather I got Doyle to write to him, the day before
      yesterday, and the letter you are now going to hear is his reply. I may
      say that we laid the circumstances full before him; especially the
      shortness of the time. You&rsquo;re not the only person who thought of that
      difficulty, Major. Just read the letter, will you, Doyle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doyle took up the letter which lay on the table in front of him and
      unfolded it. He glanced at it and then put it down and began to fumble in
      his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Doyle. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t that letter, but another one
      altogether.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew his packet of papers from his pocket again and began to go through
      them rapidly. There was a light tap at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who on earth&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;I said specially that this
      meeting was not to be disturbed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly Doyle&rsquo;s nephew,&rdquo; said the Major, &ldquo;with a sample statue. He ought
      to submit samples to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in whoever you are,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary Ellen half opened the door and put her head into the room. Dr.
      O&rsquo;Grady realised the moment he saw her that something must have gone wrong
      in the dressmaker&rsquo;s shop. He assumed, without enquiry, that Mrs. Ford had
      been making herself objectionable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has Mrs. Ford done now?&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go to her till
      this meeting is over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Ford&rsquo;s off home this half hour,&rdquo; said Mary Ellen. &ldquo;She said she
      wouldn&rsquo;t put up with the nonsense that was going on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was a relief to Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. If Mrs. Ford had gone home the
      difficulty, whatever it was, must be capable of adjustment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what on earth do you want? Surely you and Mrs. Gregg haven&rsquo;t been
      quarrelling with each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Gregg says&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; said Mary Ellen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she paused, looked at Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, looked at Doyle, and finally took
      courage after a glance at Father McCormack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She says, is there to be white stockings?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;White stockings would be entirely out
      of place. If we&rsquo;re dressing you as an Irish colleen, Mary Ellen, we&rsquo;ll do
      it properly. Go and tell Mrs. Gregg that your stockings are to be green,
      bright green. Did you ever hear such a silly question?&rdquo; he added turning
      to the other members of the committee. &ldquo;Who ever saw an Irish colleen in
      white stockings?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;While you&rsquo;re at it, O&rsquo;Grady,&rdquo; said the Major, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d better settle the
      colour of her garters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary Ellen, grinning broadly, withdrew her head and shut the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that about green stockings for Mary Ellen?&rdquo; said Father McCormack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;The stockings will scarcely show
      at all. Her dress will be right down to her ankles, longer by far than the
      ones she usually wears. I needn&rsquo;t tell you, Father McCormack, that I
      wouldn&rsquo;t consent to dressing the girl in any way that wasn&rsquo;t strictly
      proper. You mustn&rsquo;t think&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t thinking anything of the sort,&rdquo; said Father McCormack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You very well might be,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;Anyone would think we
      intended her to appear in a ballet skirt after that remark of the Major&rsquo;s
      about her garters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All I was thinking,&rdquo; said Father McCormack, &ldquo;was that if you dressed the
      girl up in that style she&rsquo;ll never be contented again with ordinary
      clothes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be opposed, so I would,&rdquo; said Gallagher, &ldquo;to anything that wouldn&rsquo;t
      be respectable in the case of Mary Ellen. Her mother was a cousin of my
      own, and I&rsquo;ve a feeling for the girl. So if you or any other one, Doctor,
      is planning contrivances&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t be ridiculous, Thady,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you she&rsquo;ll be all right. Now, Doyle, will you read us that letter
      from your nephew? If we don&rsquo;t get on with our business we&rsquo;ll be here all
      night.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t find the letter high or low,&rdquo; said Doyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe now,&rdquo; said Father McCormack, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not in your pocket at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It should be,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;for it was there I put it after showing it to
      the doctor here yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;you can tell us what he said in
      your own words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I told my nephew,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;when I was writing to him, was that
      the committee was a bit pressed in the matter of time, owing to next
      Thursday week being the only day that it was convenient for the
      Lord-Lieutenant to attend for the opening of the statue. Well, gentlemen,
      by the height of good luck it just happens that my nephew has a statue on
      hand which he thinks would do us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has what?&rdquo; said the Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A statue that has been left on his hands,&rdquo; said Doyle. &ldquo;The way of it was
      this. It was ordered by the relatives of a deceased gentleman, and it was
      to have been put up in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Cathedral in Dublin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That shows,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;that it&rsquo;s a first rate statue. They
      wouldn&rsquo;t let you put up anything second rate in a cathedral like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be a good one, surely,&rdquo; said Father McCormack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But when the relatives of the deceased party went into his affairs,&rdquo; said
      Doyle, &ldquo;they found he hadn&rsquo;t died near as well off as they thought he was
      going to; so they told my nephew that they wouldn&rsquo;t take the statue and
      couldn&rsquo;t pay for it. It was pretty near finished at the time, and what my
      nephew says is that he could make sure of having it ready for us by the
      end of this week at the latest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, O&rsquo;Grady,&rdquo; said the Major, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m as fond of a joke as any man;
      but I must draw the line somewhere. I&rsquo;m hanged if I&rsquo;ll be mixed up in any
      way with a second-hand statue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not second-hand,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s perfectly new. At this
      moment it isn&rsquo;t even finished; I wouldn&rsquo;t ask this committee to buy
      anything second hand. But you can surely see, Major&mdash;you do see, for
      you raised the point yourself, that with the very short time at our
      disposal we must, if we are to have a statue at all, get one that&rsquo;s more
      or less ready made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;Good Heavens! O&rsquo;Grady,&rdquo; said the Major. &ldquo;How can you possibly
      put up a statue of somebody else and call it General John Regan? It won&rsquo;t
      be the least like him. How can you&mdash;the thing&rsquo;s too absurd even for
      you. Who was this man that the statue was made for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was he, Doyle?&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t really matter to us who
      he was; but you may as well tell the Major so as to satisfy him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I disremember his name,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;and I can&rsquo;t lay my hand on the
      letter; but he was a Deputy-Lieutenant of whatever county he belonged to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you are now, Major,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;A Deputy-Lieutenant!
      Nothing could be more respectable than that. You&rsquo;re only a J.P. yourself,
      and I don&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;ll ever be anything more. You can&rsquo;t afford to turn
      up your nose at a Deputy-Lieutenant. We shan&rsquo;t be doing any injury to the
      General&rsquo;s reputation by allowing him to be represented by a man of high
      position, most likely of good family, who was at all events supposed to be
      well off before he died.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t thinking of the General&rsquo;s reputation,&rdquo; said the Major. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      care a hang&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that we are bound to consider the feelings of the
      Deputy-Lieutenant,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;After all, if a man deliberately
      leads his relatives to suppose that he is rich enough to afford a statue
      in a cathedral and then turns out to be too poor to pay for it, he doesn&rsquo;t
      deserve much consideration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t cross the road,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;to do a good turn to a man that
      let my nephew in the way that fellow did. For let me tell you, gentlemen,
      that statue would have been a serious loss to him if&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not thinking of him or Doyle&rsquo;s nephew either,&rdquo; said the Major. &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t know who that Deputy-Lieutenant was, and I don&rsquo;t care if his statue
      was stuck up in every market town in Ireland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re not thinking of the General,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;and if you&rsquo;re
      not thinking of the Deputy-Lieutenant, what on earth are you grumbling
      about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m grumbling, as you call it,&rdquo; said the Major, &ldquo;about the utterly
      intolerable absurdity of the whole thing. Can&rsquo;t you see it? You can of
      course, but you won&rsquo;t. Look here, Father McCormack, you&rsquo;re a man of some
      sense and decency of feeling. Can we possibly ask the Lord-Lieutenant to
      come here and unveil a statue of General John Regan&mdash;whoever he was&mdash;when
      all we&rsquo;ve got is a statue of some other man? Quite possibly the
      Lord-Lieutenant may have known that Deputy-Lieutenant personally, and if
      he recognises the statue where shall we be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something in what the Major says,&rdquo; said Father McCormack. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
      not deny there&rsquo;s something in what he says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;Excuse my contradicting you flatly,
      Father McCormack, but there really isn&rsquo;t. We all know Doyle, and we
      respect him; but I put it to you now, Father McCormack, I put it to any
      member of the committee: Is Doyle likely to have a nephew who&rsquo;d be able to
      make a statue that anybody would recognise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something in that,&rdquo; said Father McCormack. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not well up in
      statues, but I&rsquo;ve seen a few in my time, and all I can say is that unless
      Doyle&rsquo;s nephew is a great deal better at the job than most of the fellows
      that makes them, nobody would know, unless they were told, who their
      statue&rsquo;s meant to be like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My nephew&rsquo;s a good sculptor,&rdquo; said Doyle. &ldquo;If he wasn&rsquo;t I wouldn&rsquo;t have
      brought his name forward to-day; but what the doctor says is true enough.
      I&rsquo;ve seen heads he&rsquo;s done, for mural tablets and the like, and so far as
      anybody recognising them for portraits of the deceased goes, you might
      have changed the tablets and, barring the inscriptions, nobody would have
      known to the differ. Not but what they were well done, every one of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There now, Major,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;That pretty well disposes of your
      last objection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s only a side issue,&rdquo; said the Major, speaking with a calm which was
      evidently forced. &ldquo;My point is that we can&rsquo;t, in ordinary decency, put up
      a statue of one man to represent another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I altogether agree with the Major there,&rdquo; said Father
      McCormack, &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s something in what he says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see that there&rsquo;s anything,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;Deputy-Lieutenants
      have uniforms, haven&rsquo;t they? So have Generals. Nobody can possibly know
      what the uniform of a Bolivian General was fifty or a hundred years ago.
      All we could do, even if we were having the statue entirely made to order,
      would be to guess at the uniform. It&rsquo;s just as likely to be that of a
      modern Deputy-Lieutenant as anything else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true of course,&rdquo; said Father McCormack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;if we&rsquo;re to have a statue at all it&rsquo;ll have to be
      this one. There&rsquo;s no other for us to get, so what&rsquo;s the use of talking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Major shrugged his shoulders helplessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s evidently no use my talking,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it your wish then, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Father McCormack, &ldquo;that the offer
      of Mr. Aloysius Doyle to supply a statue of General John Regan be accepted
      by the committee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Subject to the price being satisfactory,&rdquo; said Gallagher. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t
      heard the price yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have the letter about the price which my nephew sent me,&rdquo; said Doyle,
      &ldquo;and I think you&rsquo;ll all agree with me that he&rsquo;s giving it cheap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He ought to,&rdquo; said Gallagher, &ldquo;considering that if he doesn&rsquo;t sell it to
      us it&rsquo;s not likely he&rsquo;ll sell it at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The demand for second-hand statues must be small,&rdquo; said the Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What he says is,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;that considering he&rsquo;s dealing with a
      member of his own family he&rsquo;ll let the statue go at no more than the price
      of the raw material, not making any charge for the work he&rsquo;s putting into
      it. I don&rsquo;t know that we can expect more than that from him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot, of course,&rdquo; said Father McCormack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hear the figure,&rdquo; said Gallagher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say,&rdquo; said the Major, &ldquo;that £10 would be a liberal offer on our
      part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut up, Major,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;What do you know about the price of
      statues? You wouldn&rsquo;t get a plaster cast of a pet dog for £10.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doyle smiled amiably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not a man in Ballymoy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;fonder of a joke than the
      Major.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hear the figure,&rdquo; said Gallagher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What he says,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;is £81.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Major Kent whistled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I wouldn&rsquo;t wonder,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;but you could get him to knock 10s.
      off that and say £80 10s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. O&rsquo;Grady pulled a sheet of paper towards him and began to write
      rapidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Statue £80 10s.,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Carriage, say £1 10s. The railway companies
      are robbers. Expenses of erection, say £2. You&rsquo;ll let us have any mortar
      and cement that are needed for nothing, Doyle; so we&rsquo;ll only have to pay
      for labour. I&rsquo;ll superintend the erection without charging a fee.
      Illuminated Address, £4. Bouquet £1 is. That&rsquo;s a good deal to give for a
      bouquet, but I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll get a decent one for less. Dresses, etc.,
      for Mary Ellen&mdash;the green stockings will have to be ordered
      specially, and so will come to a little money. And we may have to get that
      grey tweed dress which Mrs. Ford wants, just to prevent her kicking up a
      row. Two dresses, stockings, etc., for Mary Ellen, say £4. That will
      include shoes with buckles. She&rsquo;ll have to wear an Irish brooch of some
      sort, but we&rsquo;ll probably be able to borrow that. Lunch for the Vice Regal
      party on the day of the unveiling&mdash;there&rsquo;ll be at least four of them,
      say five in case of accidents. That will allow for two aides de camp and a
      private secretary. They can&rsquo;t want more. The five of us and Mr. Billing,
      who said he&rsquo;d be back for the ceremony. That makes eleven. I suppose you
      could do us really well, Doyle, at 7s. 6d. a head, including drinks, and
      there&rsquo;ll have to be three or four bottles of champagne on the sideboard,
      just for the look of the thing. We may not have to open more than one.
      Eleven times 7s. 6d. makes £4 2s. 6d. What do you mean to charge us for
      the printing of the posters, Gallagher?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say £3,&rdquo; said Gallagher, &ldquo;to include posters and advertisements in
      the paper. I&rsquo;ll be losing money on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll not be losing much,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;but we&rsquo;ll say £3. That
      will make&mdash;let me see&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He added up his column of figures and then checked the result by adding
      them downwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That comes to £100 3s. 6d.,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ve not put down anything
      for postage. You&rsquo;ll have to get your nephew to knock another 10s. off the
      price of the statue. After all, when he said £81, he must have been
      prepared to take £80, and he&rsquo;ll have to cut the inscription for us without
      extra charge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He might,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;if we approached him on the subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll have to,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;for £100 is all we&rsquo;ve got, and we
      can&rsquo;t run into debt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did say,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;that 3d. a letter was the regular charge for
      cutting inscriptions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make it short,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t stick him for more than
      about 10s. over the inscription. After all long inscriptions are vulgar. I
      propose that Mr. Thaddeus Gallagher, as the only representative of the
      press among us, be commissioned to write the inscription.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t have a better man,&rdquo; said Father McCormack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not do it,&rdquo; said Gallagher. He had a solid reason for refusing the
      honour offered to him. The writer of an inscription at the base of a
      statue is almost bound to make some statement about the person whom the
      statue represents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will now, Thady,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;ll do it well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not,&rdquo; said Gallagher. &ldquo;Let the doctor do it himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no man in Connacht better fit to draw up an inscription of the
      kind,&rdquo; said Father McCormack, &ldquo;than Mr. Gallagher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thady Gallagher was susceptible to flattery. He would have liked very well
      to draw up an inscription for the statue, modelling it on the resolutions
      which he was accustomed to propose at political meetings in favour of&rsquo; 
      Home Rule. But he was faced with what seemed to him an insuperable
      difficulty. He did not know who General John Regan was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let the doctor do it,&rdquo; he said reluctantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whoever does it,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll have to be done at once. My nephew
      said that on account of the way we are pressed for time he&rsquo;d be glad if
      the words of the inscription was wired to him to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would, maybe, be better,&rdquo; said Father McCor-mack, &ldquo;if you were to do
      it, doctor. We&rsquo;ll all be sorry that the words don&rsquo;t come from the
      accomplished pen of our respected fellow citizen, Mr. Gallagher&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not do it,&rdquo; said Gallagher, &ldquo;for I wouldn&rsquo;t know what to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Write it out and have done with it, O&rsquo;Grady,&rdquo; said the Major. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the
      good of keeping us sitting here all day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;After all, it&rsquo;s not much trouble. How
      would this do? &lsquo;General John Regan&mdash;Patriot&mdash;Soldier&mdash;Statesman&mdash;Vivat
      Bolivia&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t do better,&rdquo; said Father McCormack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the meaning of the poetry at the end of it?&rdquo; asked Gallagher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not poetry,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;and it doesn&rsquo;t mean much. It&rsquo;s the
      Latin for &lsquo;Long live Bolivia.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gallagher rose to his feet. He had been obliged to confess himself unable
      to write an inscription; but he was thoroughly well able to make a speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Considering,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that the town of Ballymoy is in the Province of
      Connacht which is one of the provinces of Ireland, and considering the
      unswerving attachment through long centuries of alien oppression which the
      Irish people have shown to the cause of national independence, it&rsquo;s my
      opinion that there should be something in the inscription, be the same
      more or less, about Home Rule. What I say, and what I&rsquo;ve always said&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put &lsquo;Esto Perpetua,&rsquo; if you like.
      It&rsquo;s the same number of letters, and it&rsquo;s what Grattan said about the last
      Home Rule Parliament. That ought to satisfy you, and I&rsquo;m sure the Major
      won&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty well past minding anything now,&rdquo; said the Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no example in history,&rdquo; said Gallagher, &ldquo;of determined devotion
      to a great cause equal to that of the Irish people who have been returning
      Members of Parliament pledged to the demand which has been made with
      unfaltering tongue on the floor of the House at Westminster&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get a telegraph form, Doyle,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;and copy out that
      inscription while Thady is finishing his speech.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one other point that I&rsquo;d like to mention,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s
      this&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a minute, Thady,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll just deal with this point
      of Doyle&rsquo;s and then you&rsquo;ll be able to go on without interruption. What is
      it, Doyle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My nephew says,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;that he&rsquo;d be glad of a cheque on account
      for the statue; he having been put to a good deal of out-of-pocket
      expense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;send him £25. Now go on, Thady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it me send him £25?&rdquo; said Doyle doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s you. You&rsquo;re the treasurer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s you has Mr. Billing&rsquo;s cheque,&rdquo; said Doyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got Mr. Billing&rsquo;s cheque,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Doyle, helplessly, &ldquo;who has?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my belief,&rdquo; said Gallagher, in a tone of extreme satisfaction, &ldquo;that
      there&rsquo;s no cheque in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say, Doyle,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;that you&rsquo;ve been such a
      besotted idiot as to let that American escape out of this without paying
      over his subscription for the statue?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never see <i>him</i> again,&rdquo; said Gallagher. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not the first
      man that skipped the country after letting everybody in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Father McCormack, &ldquo;order, please, order.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to drop the whole thing now,&rdquo; said the Major, &ldquo;and I must say
      I&rsquo;m extremely glad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no more an idiot than you are yourself, doctor,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;and I
      won&rsquo;t have language of the kind used to me. How was I to know he hadn&rsquo;t
      given you the cheque?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were the treasurer,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;What on earth is a treasurer
      for if he doesn&rsquo;t get in the subscriptions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That nephew of yours will have his statue on his hands a bit longer,&rdquo;
       said Gallagher.
    </p>
    <p>
      He still spoke in a tone of satisfaction; but even as he contemplated the
      extreme disappointment of Doyle&rsquo;s nephew it occurred to him that there
      might be a difficulty about paying his own bill for £3. The same thought
      struck Father McCormack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s been an unfortunate mistake, but it might
      be worse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That American fellow has us robbed,&rdquo; said Gallagher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll prosecute him when we catch him,&rdquo; said Doyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might be worse,&rdquo; said Father McCormack. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t spent very much
      yet. The dresses for Mary Ellen can hardly have been put in hand yet, so
      we won&rsquo;t have to pay for them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s my bill,&rdquo; said Gallagher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So there&rsquo;s only Mr. Gallagher&rsquo;s little account,&rdquo; said Father McCormack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have a house-to-house collection,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;till we get the
      money raised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a blithering idiot, Doyle,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;How can you go
      round and ask people to subscribe to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Father McCormack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must fall back upon the subscription list that was published in the <i>Connacht
      Eagle</i>,&rdquo; said the Major, &ldquo;as well as I recollect we all promised&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody promised anything,&rdquo; said Doyle. &ldquo;It was Dr. O&rsquo;Grady that promised
      for us and before I pay a penny for a man that owes me more this minute
      than he can pay&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, do shut up, Doyle,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the good of raking up
      the past? What we&rsquo;ve got to do now is to find a way out of the confounded
      hole we&rsquo;ve been let into through your incompetence and carelessness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m down for £5,&rdquo; said the Major, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll consider that I&rsquo;m very well
      out of this business if I have to pay no more. I&rsquo;d rather give five pounds
      any day than stand by watching Mary Ellen and the Lord-Lieutenant making
      faces at a second-hand statue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a handsome offer, so it is,&rdquo; said Father McCormack, &ldquo;and the thanks
      of the meeting&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not pay a penny,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;and what&rsquo;s more, if the doctor
      doesn&rsquo;t pay me what he owes me I&rsquo;ll put him into the County Court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s you that&rsquo;ll have to pay,&rdquo; said Gallagher, &ldquo;whether you like it or
      not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m damned if I do,&rdquo; said Doyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Father McCormack, &ldquo;will you mind what you&rsquo;re
      saying? That&rsquo;s no language to be using, Mr. Doyle; and I don&rsquo;t think the
      doctor has any right&mdash;not that I mind myself what you say for I&rsquo;m not
      particular; but if it was to get out to the ears of the general public
      that this meeting had been conducting itself in ways that&rsquo;s very far from
      being reputable&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no general public here,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s just as
      well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I&rsquo;m trying to tell you,&rdquo; said Father McCormack, &ldquo;and what I would
      tell you if you&rsquo;d listen to me, is that there&rsquo;s somebody knocking at the
      door of the room we&rsquo;re in and whoever it is must have heard every word
      that&rsquo;s been said this last five minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doyle and Gallagher stopped growling at each other when the priest spoke.
      Dr. O&rsquo;Grady sat upright in his chair and bent his head towards the door.
      There was a moment&rsquo;s silence in the room and a very faint, as it were an
      apologetic, knock was heard at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary Ellen opened the door and looked in. She appeared to be rather
      frightened. If, as Father McCormack supposed she heard every word spoken
      during the previous five minutes, she had very good reason for feeling
      nervous. She had a still better reason a moment later when Doyle caught
      sight of her. Doyle had completely lost command of his temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get away out of that, Mary Ellen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and if I catch sight of you
      here again before I call for you I&rsquo;ll have the two ears cut off you and
      yourself sent home to your mother with them in a paper parcel in the well
      of the car.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Curiously enough this appalling threat seemed to cheer Mary Ellen a
      little. She smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Gregg says&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re not outside the door and it shut after you before I&rsquo;ve done
      speaking I&rsquo;ll do what I&rsquo;ve said and worse on top of that,&rdquo; said Doyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t have Mary Ellen bullied,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all you&rsquo;re fit
      for, Doyle, to frighten helpless little girls. If you&rsquo;d talked that way to
      Billing when he was trying to run away without paying&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a nice one to talk about paying,&rdquo; said Doyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. O&rsquo;Grady left his seat and walked over lo the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it now, Mary Ellen?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Gregg says,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;will I be wearing a hat or will I not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go back to Mrs. Gregg,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;and tell her that you will not
      wear a hat, but you&rsquo;ll have your hair tied up with a green silk ribbon to
      match your stockings. Would you like that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d as soon have a hat,&rdquo; said Mary Ellen, &ldquo;and Mr. Moriarty says&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely to goodness,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;he hasn&rsquo;t been helping to order
      your clothes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has not,&rdquo; said Mary Ellen, &ldquo;but he was outside the barrack and me
      coming along the street&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He always is,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he said to me that it wouldn&rsquo;t do for me to be dressed up any way
      foolish like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let Constable Moriarty mind his own business,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;You go
      back and tell Mrs. Gregg what I say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other members of the committee sat listening with amazed interest to
      all Dr. O&rsquo;Grady said to Mary Ellen. Even Doyle was too much astonished to
      attempt an interruption. He said nothing till the doctor, having dismissed
      Mary Ellen, returned to the table. Then he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who&rsquo;s going to pay for the green ribbon which is to go along with the
      stockings? Who&rsquo;s going to pay for it? That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m asking you. You
      needn&rsquo;t be thinking that I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;I owe you all an apology. I&rsquo;m afraid I
      lost my temper for a minute or two. Father McCormack, I beg your pardon,
      and if I said&mdash;as I fear I did say&mdash;anything disrespectful to
      you as chairman&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak another word, Doctor,&rdquo; said Father McCormack, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve said
      enough. Sure anyone might have been betrayed into a strong expression when
      he was provoked. Not that you said a word to me that you&rsquo;ve any reason to
      be sorry for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Major Kent,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;if I&rsquo;ve in any way insulted you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not worse than usual,&rdquo; said Major Kent. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite accustomed to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Doyle,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that in the heat of the moment I
      may have&mdash;but I can do no more than ask your pardon&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care a thraneen,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;what you called me, and I&rsquo;ll give
      you leave to call me that and more every day of the week if you see your
      way to get the £100 out of the American gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;but I have a proposal to lay before
      the meeting which I think will get us out of our difficulty.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let you speak out,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;and if so be that you&rsquo;re not asking us
      to pay up&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we may take it for granted, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;that
      if we produce a creditable statue for the Lord-Lieutenant to unveil and
      give him a really gratifying illuminated address&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The statue and the illuminated address would be all right,&rdquo; said Doyle,
      &ldquo;if there was any way of paying for them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a bouquet,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady; &ldquo;and a good luncheon. If we do all that
      and make ourselves generally agreeable by means of Mary Ellen and in other
      ways the Lord-Lieutenant couldn&rsquo;t very well refuse to give us a grant of
      Government money to build a pier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s likely he&rsquo;d give it,&rdquo; said Father McCormack, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s likely enough
      that he&rsquo;d give it&mdash;if we&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t well not,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;after us giving him a lunch and all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If so be,&rdquo; said Gallagher, &ldquo;that he was to refuse at the latter end we&rsquo;d
      have questions asked about him in Parliament; and believe you me that&rsquo;s
      what he wouldn&rsquo;t like. Them fellows is terrible afraid of the Irish
      Members. And they&rsquo;ve a good right to be, for devil the finer set of men
      you&rsquo;d see anywhere than what they are. There isn&rsquo;t a thing goes wrong in
      the country but they&rsquo;re ready to torment the life out of whoever might be
      responsible for the man that did it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;Now do we want a pier?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We want the money,&rdquo; said Doyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Father McCormack, &ldquo;could we get the money without
      we&rsquo;d build a pier when we&rsquo;d got it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My point is,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;that the pier itself, the actual stone
      structure sticking out into the sea, being no particular use to any one
      once it&rsquo;s built&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;d be a public nuisance,&rdquo; said the Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can do very well with an inferior kind of pier,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady.
      &ldquo;What I mean to say is we might spend a little less than we&rsquo;re actually
      given.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about the inspector they&rsquo;d send down?&rdquo; said Doyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Them inspectors,&rdquo; said Gallagher, &ldquo;is as thick about the country as fleas
      on a dog. Hardly ever a man would turn round without he&rsquo;d have one of them
      asking him what he was doing it for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For once Gallagher had spoken in a way that was acceptable to the other
      members of the committee. There was a general murmur of assent. Everyone
      present was more or less conscious of the enormous numbers of inspectors
      in Ireland. Even Major Kent, who had been in a bad temper all along,
      brightened up a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was reading a paper the other day,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that 80 per cent, of the
      adult population of Leinster, Munster and Connacht, were paid by the
      Government to teach the other people how to get their livings, and to see
      that they did what they were told. That included schoolmasters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder now,&rdquo; said Father McCormack, &ldquo;that those figures would
      be about right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was only the week before last,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;that there was a man
      stopping in my hotel, a man that looked as if he was earning a comfortable
      salary, and he&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doyle spoke in the tone of a man who is going to tell a long and leisurely
      story. Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, who had heard the story before, interrupted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course we&rsquo;d have to talk to the inspector when he comes,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d do that, O&rsquo;Grady,&rdquo; said the Major. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d talk to a bench of
      bishops.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure,&rdquo; said Father McCormack, &ldquo;that I quite see what the doctor&rsquo;s
      getting at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s simple enough,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;Suppose he offers us £500 for a
      pier&mdash;he can&rsquo;t well make it less&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be more,&rdquo; said Doyle optimistically. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be nearer a thousand
      pounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say £500,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;What I propose is that we spend £400 on a
      pier and use the other hundred to pay for the statue and the rest of the
      things we have to get.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bedamn,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;but that&rsquo;s great. That&rsquo;s the best ever I heard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Major Kent rose to his feet. He was very red in the face, and there was a
      look of rigid determination in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may as well tell you at once,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;ll have nothing to do
      with any such plan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m an honest man. I raised no particular objection when you
      merely proposed to make a fool of me and everybody else concerned&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done very little else except raise objections,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;But when it comes to a deliberate act of dishonesty&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a hard word, so it is,&rdquo; said Doyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a bit too hard,&rdquo; said the Major, &ldquo;and I say it again.
      Dishonesty. I won&rsquo;t have anything to do&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Major&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said Father McCormack, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no denying it, the
      Major&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He would be right,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;he&rsquo;d be perfectly right if there
      were any dishonesty about the matter. I hope it isn&rsquo;t necessary for me to
      say that if I thought the plan a dishonest one I&rsquo;d be the last man in
      Ireland to propose it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, of course,&rdquo; said Father McCormack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The doctor wouldn&rsquo;t do the like,&rdquo; said Doyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure we all know that,&rdquo; said Father McCormack, &ldquo;but the objection that
      the Major has raised&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very well talking,&rdquo; said the Major. &ldquo;But talking won&rsquo;t alter
      facts. It is dishonest to get a grant of money for one purpose and use it
      for something totally different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not quite sure,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;whether you quite understand the
      philosophy of modern charity, Major.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand the ten commandments,&rdquo; said the Major, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s enough
      for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody&rsquo;s saying a word against the ten commandments,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to do something against one of them,&rdquo; said the Major, &ldquo;and
      that&rsquo;s worse. If you merely said things against them I shouldn&rsquo;t mind. We
      all know that you&rsquo;d say anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re begging the question, Major, you really are. Now listen to me.
      What&rsquo;s the ordinary recognised way of raising large sums of money for
      charitable objects? Some kind of bazaar, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said Father McCormack. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s hardly ever a winter but there&rsquo;s
      one or two of them up in Dublin for hospitals or the like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;What happens when a bazaar is held?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter to us what happens,&rdquo; said the Major. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not holding
      one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let the doctor speak,&rdquo; said Doyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What happens is this,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;A large sum of money, very
      often an enormous sum, is spent on getting up switch-back railways, and
      Alpine panoramas, and underground rivers, and old English villages. Those
      things are absolutely necessary to the success of the show. They cost
      thousands of pounds sometimes. Now, who pays for them? The charity pays,
      and is jolly glad to. The price of them is deducted from the gross
      receipts and the balance is handed over to the hospital. Is there anything
      dishonest about that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is not, of course,&rdquo; said Father McCormack. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s always done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t a bishop do it? A bishop of any church?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lots of them do,&rdquo; said Father McCormack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if a bishop would do it, it can&rsquo;t be dishonest,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady.
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll agree to that, I suppose, Major? You won&rsquo;t want to accuse the
      hierarchy of Ireland, Protestant and Roman Catholics, of flying in the
      face of the ten commandments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Major had sat down again. While Dr. O&rsquo;Grady was speaking he turned his
      chair half round and stared out of the window. He wished to convey the
      impression that he was not listening to a word that was said. When Dr.
      O&rsquo;Grady appealed to him directly he turned round again and answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s dishonest to take money given for one purpose and use it for
      another,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m with you there, Major,&rdquo; said Father McCormack. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m with you there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you prepared,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;to go back on the whole theory of
      necessary expenses? Would you refuse to allow the unfortunate secretary of
      a charitable society to refund himself for the postage stamps he uses in
      sending out his appeals?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Secretaries have nothing to do with us,&rdquo; said the Major. &ldquo;This is a
      simple question of right and wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t quite caught my point yet,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady patiently. &ldquo;What
      I&rsquo;m trying to explain to you is this: we&rsquo;re in exactly the same position
      as the charity that&rsquo;s getting up a bazaar. In order to make the money we
      want for the good of the town&mdash;the good of the town, mind you, Major&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      a worthy object.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A pier wouldn&rsquo;t be any good if you had it,&rdquo; said the Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lot of money would be spent building it,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;and that
      would do us all good. But in order to get a pier we must incur some
      expense. We shan&rsquo;t get the pier unless we succeed in enticing a
      Lord-Lieutenant down here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not,&rdquo; said Doyle. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s waste of time writing letters to those
      fellows, for they don&rsquo;t read them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we can&rsquo;t get the Lord-Lieutenant down unless we have a statue for him
      to unveil,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t come without he had something of the sort,&rdquo; said Father
      McCormack. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Therefore,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;the statue is a necessary part of our
      expenses in getting the pier. So is the illuminated address. So is the
      bouquet. And we&rsquo;re just as well entitled to charge what they all cost us
      against the money we succeed in making, as the secretary of a charitable
      bazaar is to debit his gross earnings with the hire of the hall in which
      the show is held.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now that you put it in that way,&rdquo; said Father McCormack, &ldquo;I can see well
      that there&rsquo;s something in what you say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honesty and dishonesty are two different things,&rdquo; said the Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t keep on making those bald and senseless assertions,&rdquo; said Dr.
      O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;Even an income tax collector, and he&rsquo;s the most sceptical kind
      of man there is with regard to assertions about money&mdash;but even he
      allows his victims to deduct the expenses necessarily incurred in making
      their incomes from the gross amount which they return to him. You can&rsquo;t
      want to go behind the income tax authorities, Major.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very well arguing,&rdquo; said the Major, &ldquo;and I can&rsquo;t answer you when
      you confuse things in the way you do. But I know perfectly well that it
      isn&rsquo;t right&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well do what the doctor says, anyway,&rdquo; said Doyle. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t the
      Government rob the whole of us every day more than ever we&rsquo;ll be able to
      rob it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something in that, too,&rdquo; said Father McCormack.
    </p>
    <p>
      Curiously enough Doyle&rsquo;s statement produced far more effect on Major
      Kent&rsquo;s mind than the elaborate arguments of Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. He was accustomed
      to gnash his teeth over the burden of taxation laid upon him. He had
      often, in private conversation, described governments, especially Liberal
      Governments, as bandits and thieves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are robbed,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I admit that. What with the extra tax on
      unearned income and the insurance of servants against accidents, and this
      infernal new unemployment insurance, and the death duties, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a report of the Financial Relations Commission,&rdquo; said
      Gallagher, &ldquo;which presented a case on behalf of Ireland that showed&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t drag in politics, Thady,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;The Major admits that
      he&rsquo;s robbed. That ought to be enough for you. Now, Major, if you were
      attacked by a highwayman&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say the Government was a highwayman,&rdquo; said the Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said it was a robber. Didn&rsquo;t he, Father Mc-Cormack?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said it had him robbed,&rdquo; said Father McCormack, with the air of a man
      who is carefully making a fine distinction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly the same thing. Now, Major, if a robber stole your money,
      wouldn&rsquo;t you take the first chance you could of getting it back? You know
      you would. We all would. And would you call that dishonesty? You would
      not. Now we&rsquo;re offering you the chance of getting something back, a mere
      trifle, but still something, out of a Government which, as you admit, has
      robbed you. Why on earth do you start making a fuss?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t argue with you, O&rsquo;Grady,&rdquo; said the Major, &ldquo;but you&rsquo;re wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the good of talking?&rdquo; said Doyle. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do what the doctor says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your nephew won&rsquo;t be able to get that advance he asked for,&rdquo; said Dr.
      O&rsquo;Grady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him not,&rdquo; said Doyle. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t pity him. He&rsquo;ll get his money in the
      end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said Father McCormack, &ldquo;is it your will that the plan now
      laid before the meeting by Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, be adopted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said Gallagher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What else is there for us to do?&rdquo; said Doyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may take me as dissenting,&rdquo; said the Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make a note of that in the minutes,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;and then
      your conscience will be perfectly clear, no matter what happens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Father McCormack, &ldquo;I suppose that completes our
      arrangements for to-day. When shall we have our next meeting?&rdquo; He rose to
      his feet as he spoke. Everyone else rose too. Major Kent put on his hat
      and walked towards the door. When he reached it he turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t come to any more meetings,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any necessity to hold another meeting,&rdquo; said Dr.
      O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;until after the Lord-Lieutenant has left and the time comes for
      squaring up things. I shall be so busy between this and the day of his
      visit that I shan&rsquo;t have time to attend meetings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Father McCormack. &ldquo;I shall be all the better pleased.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He left the room and followed Major Kent down the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thady,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;do you go down to the bar, and I&rsquo;ll be with you in a
      minute. I&rsquo;ve a word to say to the doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could do with a sup of porter after all that talk,&rdquo; said Gallagher, as
      he left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;if things turn out the way we hope&mdash;&mdash;&ldquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re knocking a commission out of that nephew of yours for
      selling his statue for him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty-five per pent, is the amount agreed on. It isn&rsquo;t everyone I&rsquo;d
      tell, but I&rsquo;ve confidence in you, doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if we get £500 for the pier?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A middling good pier,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;as good a pier as anyone&rsquo;d have a
      right to expect in a place like this, might be built for £300.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll put £120 into your pocket, Doyle, not counting anything you may
      make on the luncheons!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I was meaning to say, doctor, is, that it would be a satisfaction to
      me if there was something coming to yourself. You deserve it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Doyle; but I&rsquo;m not in this business to make money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be well,&rdquo; said Doyle with a sigh, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;d make a little more
      now and again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to start about that wretched bill I owe you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not then. Nor I won&rsquo;t mention it to you until such time as you might
      be able to pay it. If so be that things turn out the way you say I
      shouldn&rsquo;t care&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you keep Gallagher waiting too long for his drink,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady,
      &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll start breaking things. He must be uncommonly thirsty after all the
      speeches he made this afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said Doyle. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d maybe better go to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Constable Moriarty stood just outside the door of the hotel. He saluted
      Major Kent as he passed. He touched his hat respectfully to Father
      McCormack. He saw Gallagher come downstairs and enter the bar. A few
      minutes later he saw Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. All traces of his usual smile vanished
      from his face. He drew himself up stiffly, and his eyes expressed
      something more than official severity. When Dr. O&rsquo;Grady passed through the
      door into the street, Moriarty confronted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to see,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;that you&rsquo;ve stopped grinning. It&rsquo;s
      quite time you did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not grins I&rsquo;m talking about now,&rdquo; said Moriarty. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Mary Ellen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nice little girl, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a nice little girl you&rsquo;ll make of her before you&rsquo;ve done! What&rsquo;s
      this I&rsquo;m after hearing about the way you have in mind for dressing her
      up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do be reasonable, Moriarty! What&rsquo;s the good of asking me what you&rsquo;ve
      heard? I can&rsquo;t possibly know, for I wasn&rsquo;t there when you heard it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know well what I heard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Moriarty,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;If you think I&rsquo;m going to stand
      here to be bullied by you in the public street you&rsquo;re greatly mistaken.
      Why don&rsquo;t you go and patrol somewhere?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not have Mary Ellen play-acting before the Lord-Lieutenant, so now
      you know, doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no play-acting to be done,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t even
      had time to get up a pageant. I wish we had. You&rsquo;d look splendid as a
      Roman Emperor trampling on a conquered people. I&rsquo;m not sure that I
      wouldn&rsquo;t get you up as an Assyrian bull. The expression of your face is
      just right this minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary Ellen&rsquo;s an orphan girl,&rdquo; said Moriarty, &ldquo;with no father to look
      after her, and what&rsquo;s more I&rsquo;m thinking of marrying her myself. So it&rsquo;s as
      well for you to understand, doctor, that I&rsquo;ll not have her character took
      from her. It&rsquo;s not the first time you&rsquo;ve tried that same, but it had
      better be the last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about, Moriarty. There&rsquo;s nobody injuring
      the girl&rsquo;s character except, maybe, yourself. Doyle tells me you&rsquo;re never
      out of the back-yard of the hotel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You put it out that she was married to young Kerrigan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was Thady Gallagher,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;and it didn&rsquo;t do her a bit
      of harm. Nobody except Mr. Billing believed it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind that so much now,&rdquo; said Moriarty, &ldquo;though I don&rsquo;t deny I was
      angry at the time, but what I won&rsquo;t have is Mary Ellen dressed up to be an
      ancient Irish colleen. It&rsquo;s not respectful to the girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You told me the other day that you want the Lord-Lieutenant to make you a
      sergeant. Did you mean that when you said it, or did you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no way to make a sergeant of me to be dressing up Mary Ellen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s far the best way. When the Lord-Lieutenant sees her and hears&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not going to be done, anyway,&rdquo; said Moriarty, &ldquo;for I won&rsquo;t have it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me now,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;and you may take it that this is my
      last word, for I haven&rsquo;t time to waste talking to you. If I catch you
      interfering with Mary Ellen in any way or setting the girl&rsquo;s mind up
      against the costume that Mrs. Gregg has designed for her, I&rsquo;ll speak to
      Mr. Gregg, and have you transferred to some different county altogether,
      where you&rsquo;ll never see Mary Ellen either in fancy dress or any other way.
      What&rsquo;s more I&rsquo;ll represent your conduct to the Lord-Lieutenant, so that
      you&rsquo;ll never be made a sergeant as long as you live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These threats affected Moriarty. He had no doubt in his mind that Dr.
      O&rsquo;Grady could and would carry out the first of them. About the second he
      was not quite so sure, but it remained a horrible possibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw that there was nothing to be done by opposing his will to a
      powerful combination of private influence and official power. Without
      speaking another word he turned and walked across the street to the
      barrack. But his anger had by no means died away. He found Sergeant Colgan
      asleep in the living-room. He woke him at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be even with that doctor,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;before I&rsquo;ve done with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s threatening language,&rdquo; said the sergeant, who was not pleased at
      being wakened, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s actionable; so you&rsquo;d better mind yourself,
      Moriarty. There&rsquo;s many a better man than you has gone to jail for less
      than that. I knew a Member of Parliament one time that got three weeks for
      no more than saying that he&rsquo;d like to see the people beating the life out
      of a land grabber. What has the doctor been doing to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about Mary Ellen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get out,&rdquo; said the sergeant, &ldquo;you and your Mary Ellen! It&rsquo;s too fond you
      are of running here and there after that same Mary Ellen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was plain that no sympathy was to be expected from Sergeant Colgan.
      Moriarty sat down on a chair in the corner and meditated on plans of
      vengeance. The sergeant dropped off to sleep again.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII
    </h2>
    <p>
      According to the official programme&mdash;so described by Dr. O&rsquo;Grady&mdash;the
      Lord-Lieutenant and Lady Chesterton were to arrive in Ballymoy by
      motor-car at half-past twelve o&rsquo;clock. There might be two motor-cars. That
      depended on the number of aides-de-camp and of the suite which the
      Lord-Lieutenant brought. There would certainly be one, and Doyle had the
      coach-house in his back-yard emptied and carefully cleaned to serve for
      the garage. Everything in the town was ready before half-past ten. The
      statue had been erected on its pedestal the day before and excited general
      admiration. Even Major Kent admitted that it was a striking work of art
      which would be an ornament to the town. The deceased Deputy-Lieutenant was
      dressed in flowing robes which resembled those worn by judges. He held a
      large roll, intended to represent parchment, in his left hand. This, Dr.
      O&rsquo;Grady said, might very well be taken for the original draft of the
      Bolivian Constitution. His right hand pointed upwards with extended
      forefinger. In the case of the Deputy-Lieutenant, who was almost certainly
      a strong Unionist, this may have symbolised an appeal to the higher powers&mdash;the
      House of Lords, or even the King&mdash;to refuse consent to a Home Rule
      Bill. When the statue ceased to be a Deputy-Lieutenant and became General
      John Regan the attitude was taken to express his confidence in the
      heavenly nature of the national liberty which he had won for Bolivia. This
      was the explanation of the uplifted forefinger which Dr. O&rsquo;Grady offered
      to Thady Gallagher. But Gallagher was curiously sulky and suspicious. He
      seemed unimpressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doyle&rsquo;s nephew came down to Ballymoy and personally superintended the
      fixing of the statue on its pedestal. He complained that the cement
      supplied for the purpose by his uncle was of very inferior quality, and
      expressed grave doubts about the stability of the structure. Dr. O&rsquo;Grady
      did not seem very anxious. He hinted that the people of Ballymoy would be
      quite satisfied if the statue stood for twenty-four hours. The weather was
      exceptionally fine and calm. There was no reason&mdash;if the unveiling
      were carefully done&mdash;why Doyle&rsquo;s cement should be subjected to any
      strain whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      At nine o&rsquo;clock on the morning of the Lord-Lieutenant&rsquo;s visit, Dr.
      O&rsquo;Grady, with the help of Doyle and two labourers, who had three
      step-ladders, veiled the statue. They draped it from the head to the
      bottom of the pedestal in a large sheet of blay calico of a light
      yellowish colour. This was carefully done, and an elaborate arrangement of
      string was made, leading out from the statue to the place where the
      Lord-Lieutenant was to stand. Dr. O&rsquo;Grady satisfied himself by a series of
      experiments that the apparatus would work. At a single pull at the end of
      the string the whole sheet fluttered to the ground and exposed the
      Deputy-Lieutenant to public view.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was ten o&rsquo;clock before these arrangements were completed and the
      step-ladders taken away. Dr. O&rsquo;Grady went into the barrack and warned
      Sergeant Colgan that he would be held personally responsible if any
      curious wayfarer pulled the string before the proper time. Sergeant Colgan
      at once ordered Moriarty to mount guard over the statue. Dr. O&rsquo;Grady went
      over to the hotel and inspected the luncheon table. He had laid it himself
      the night before, so he felt fairly confident that everything was as it
      should be; but he was not inclined to run any risks. It was just possible
      that Doyle, acting on advice from somebody else, might have altered the
      position of the spoons and forks during the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be after lunch,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;that we&rsquo;ll introduce the
      subject of a pier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then or sooner,&rdquo; said Doyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hints will have been given before that,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;Father
      McCormack has promised to touch on the undeveloped condition of our
      fishing industry when he&rsquo;s making his introductory remarks previous to the
      unveiling of the statue. If I get half a chance, I mean to point out what
      excellent stones there are in that old mill of yours. The matter is
      distinctly alluded to at the end of the illuminated address, but I&rsquo;m
      afraid they&rsquo;re not likely to read that till they get back to Dublin, if
      then. I suppose, by the way, the address has arrived all right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;but I haven&rsquo;t it unpacked yet. It&rsquo;s in a case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;d better have it quite ready. Get a screwdriver, will you, and a
      hammer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The address turned out to be very large indeed and most magnificently
      coloured. In the top left-hand corner was a small photograph of the market
      square of Ballymoy, without the statue. In the right-hand Corner was a
      picture, supplied by Mr. Aloysius Doyle, of the statue itself. In the
      bottom left-hand corner was a photograph of the Viceregal Lodge in the
      Phoenix Park, and opposite it a portrait of the Lord-Lieutenant in his
      state robes. The whole left-hand side of the address was occupied by an
      immensely complicated design made up of spirals, serpents, and trumpet
      pattern ornaments, which twisted in and out of each other in a way most
      bewildering to the eye. This was supposed to represent the manner in which
      ancient Irish artists made the letter &ldquo;t,&rdquo; when they were not in a hurry.
      &ldquo;T&rdquo; is the first letter of the word &ldquo;to&rdquo; with which the actual address
      began. The words &ldquo;Excellency,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lieutenant&rdquo; were similarly
      honoured with capital letters of Celtic design, but inferior size.
      &ldquo;Ireland,&rdquo; which came on a line to itself, was blazoned in red and green,
      on a background of dull gold, laid on smoothly, and afterwards dinted here
      and there with some instrument which must have resembled a blunt pin. The
      rest of the letter-press was done in crooked, angular characters, very
      ornamental to look at, but most difficult to read.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good address, so it is,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;and worth the money, though,
      mind you, it was a big lot we gave for it. A cheaper one would have done
      well enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I call it cheap at the price,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d no idea you could
      get so much for £4. Now what about the bouquet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have it in a jug of water,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;under the counter of the bar.
      I thought it would be better in water the way it would be fresh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right. But be sure you wipe the stalks before you give it to Mrs.
      Gregg. It doesn&rsquo;t so much matter about Lady Chesterton. She must be pretty
      well accustomed to handling damp bouquets. But I&rsquo;d be sorry to spoil Mrs.
      Gregg&rsquo;s new gloves. She&rsquo;s sure to have new gloves. By the way, what&rsquo;s
      being done about getting Mary Ellen ready? That girl can&rsquo;t be trusted to
      dress herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Gregg is putting the clothes on her this minute,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;above
      in the best bedroom. She said she&rsquo;d do it early so as she&rsquo;d have time
      after to go home and dress herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s been no trouble with Moriarty, I suppose? I told you about the
      way he threatened me, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t said a word to me, but he&rsquo;s a fellow I wouldn&rsquo;t trust further
      than I can see him, and he&rsquo;s had an ugly look about him this three days,
      like as if he had some mischief in his mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t trust him either,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady; &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t see what he
      could do. He wouldn&rsquo;t venture to meddle with the statue, would he? Tangle
      up the strings we have tied to the sheet or anything of that sort?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He would not; for he knows well it would be the worse for him if he did.
      It&rsquo;s not likely Mr. Gregg would overlook it if Moriarty did anything that
      put a stop to Mrs. Gregg presenting the bouquet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to chance it anyway, and I don&rsquo;t see that he can do much
      except sulk, and that won&rsquo;t hurt us. I think I&rsquo;ll be getting home now,
      Doyle. I have to shave and generally clean up a bit before the Viceregal
      party arrives. You don&rsquo;t own a silk hat, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not. What would I have the like for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might have worn it if you had,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;My own is so old
      that I&rsquo;m ashamed to put it on. However, it doesn&rsquo;t really matter. Both the
      Major and Father McCormack are sure to have them, so the Lord-Lieutenant
      won&rsquo;t notice that you and I haven&rsquo;t and nobody would expect much from
      Thady Gallagher. After all, our hats will be in our hands most of the
      time, and we can keep them behind our backs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At half-past eleven Mary Ellen and Mrs. Gregg came out of the hotel
      together. Mary Ellen&rsquo;s costume was beautifully complete. An English
      tourist accustomed to buy the coloured picture postcards with which the
      Germans obligingly supply our shops, would have recognised her at once as
      an Irish colleen. Her stockings were of the brightest shade of green. Her
      shoes, which were highly polished, had aggressively square toes and
      enormous steel buckles which flashed in the sunlight as she walked. Her
      skirt reached half way down the calves of her legs. It was of crimson
      flannel, made very wide. A green and black tartan shawl was fastened round
      her with a large Tara brooch which also held in its place a trail of
      shamrock. Underneath the shawl she had a green silk blouse. It showed very
      little but it exactly matched her stockings. Her hair was brushed smoothly
      back from her forehead, and covered with a black and white-checked
      kerchief tied beneath her chin and falling in a neat triangle at the nape
      of her neck. Mrs. Gregg, who was naturally very pleased, led Mary Ellen
      over to the statue, placed her beside it, and told her not to move or in
      any way disorder her dress. Then she herself hurried away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Constable Moriarty, who was on guard beside the statue, scowled at Mary
      Ellen. He approached her slowly, walked round her, surveyed her from every
      point of view, and then snorted with intense disapproval.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mother wouldn&rsquo;t know you,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary Ellen smiled. She was greatly pleased at her own appearance and chose
      to take Moriarty&rsquo;s remark as a compliment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She might not,&rdquo; she said, in a tone of evident delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moriarty intended to say more; but at that moment the town band began to
      play. Young Kerrigan had collected the members of it early in the day and
      kept them in a group outside his father&rsquo;s shop. The arrival of Mary Ellen
      seemed to him to be a suitable occasion for a tune. He gave a signal and
      the band struck up. &ldquo;Rich and Rare Were the Gems She Wore&rdquo; was the tune on
      which they chanced. It was remarkably appropriate. The band marched twice
      round the statue playing that tune. With the last note it came to rest
      again in its old position outside Kerrigan&rsquo;s shop. Then Thady Gallagher
      came out of his office. He walked over and looked at Mary Ellen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re not ashamed of yourself,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you ought to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not, then,&rdquo; said Mary Ellen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gallagher turned to Moriarty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that the tune the band is to play is the one
      you told me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Moriarty grinned malevolently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For if you&rsquo;re playing any kind of a trick on me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not. Amn&rsquo;t I wanting to get my knife into the doctor the same as
      yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why would you want that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s on account of the way he has Mary Ellen dressed up. Will you look at
      the girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gallagher looked at her again, long and carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Play acting!&rdquo; said Moriarty, &ldquo;and she&rsquo;s a respectable girl. It&rsquo;s not
      decent, so it&rsquo;s not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the tune&rsquo;s what you say it is,&rdquo; said Gallagher, &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll not be played
      in Ballymoy to-day nor any other day. I&rsquo;ll put the fear of God into young
      Kerrigan before he&rsquo;s an hour older.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Moriarty grinned again. It seemed that, with the aid of Gallagher, he was
      going to hit Dr. O&rsquo;Grady on a vital spot. He understood that great
      importance was attached to the performance of &ldquo;Rule, Brittania&rdquo; by the
      band. Gallagher walked across to young Kerrigan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what the tune is you&rsquo;re meaning to play.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you know that,&rdquo; said Kerrigan, &ldquo;you know more than I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None of your lies now. Constable Moriarty is after telling me the name of
      the tune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you know it,&rdquo; said Kerrigan, &ldquo;maybe you&rsquo;ll tell me. Not that I care
      what the name of it is, for it&rsquo;s a good tune, name or no name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will care,&rdquo; said Gallagher. &ldquo;You will care before the day is out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you tell me the name of it, then? if so be you know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know well why I don&rsquo;t tell you. It&rsquo;s because I wouldn&rsquo;t defile my
      lips with the name of it, because I wouldn&rsquo;t say the words that would be a
      disgrace to any Irishman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re mighty particular,&rdquo; said young Kerrigan. &ldquo;It would have to be a
      pretty bad name that&rsquo;s on the tune if it&rsquo;s worse than what you said many a
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gallagher was not in a mood to submit calmly to taunts of this kind. He
      knew that he was perfectly right in refusing to pronounce the name of the
      tune. He was convinced that young Kerrigan knew and was able to talk as he
      did only because he was dead to all sense of decency or shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me tell you this,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s my last word. If that tune&rsquo;s
      played in Ballymoy to-day it&rsquo;ll be the worse for you, and the worse for
      your father, and the worse for all belonging to you. Let you not play that
      tune or the grass will be growing on the step outside your father&rsquo;s shop
      before any decent Nationalist will go into it to buy a bit of meat. Them
      that makes their living off the people will have to mind themselves that
      they don&rsquo;t outrage the convictions of the people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was an awful threat, and it cowed young Kerrigan a good deal. He did
      not believe that Gallagher was capable of having it carried out to the
      last extremity. The grass would not actually grow on his father&rsquo;s
      doorstep, because the people of the west of Ireland, though swift and
      passionate in resentment, find a difficulty in keeping up a personal
      quarrel long enough to permit of the growth of grass. But a great deal of
      temporary inconvenience might be caused by a boycott initiated by
      Gallagher and taken up by the local branch of the League. Young Kerrigan
      was shaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better speak to the doctor about it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s his tune and
      not mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will speak to the doctor,&rdquo; said Gallagher. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll speak to him in a way
      he won&rsquo;t like. I was thinking all along he was up to some mischief with
      that tune; but I didn&rsquo;t know how bad it was till Moriarty was talking to
      me this morning. Where is the doctor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was over in Doyle&rsquo;s hotel a minute ago,&rdquo; said Kerrigan, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t
      know is he there yet. He might not be, for I seen him going out of it and
      along the street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wherever he is I&rsquo;ll make it hot for him,&rdquo; said Gallagher, as he turned
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Constable Moriarty be damned,&rdquo; said young Kerrigan softly but fervently
      as soon as Gallagher was safely out of earshot. Gallagher stopped on his
      way to the hotel to take another scornful look at Mary Ellen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If your father that&rsquo;s dead was alive this day,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;he&rsquo;d turn you
      out of the house when he seen you in them clothes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary Ellen had no recollection of her father, who had died before she was
      twelve months old, but she was more hopeful about him than Gallagher
      seemed to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He might not,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Father McCormack appeared, walking briskly up the street from
      the-presbytery. He was wearing, as Dr. O&rsquo;Grady had anticipated, a silk
      hat. He had a very long and voluminous frock coat. He had even, and this
      marked his sense of the importance of the occasion, made creases down the
      fronts of his trousers. Gallagher went to meet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, Thady,&rdquo; said Father McCormack cheerfully. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re in great
      luck with the weather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said Gallagher, &ldquo;you were always one that was heart and soul
      with the people of Ireland, and it will make you sorry, so it will, sorry
      and angry, to hear what I have to tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father McCormack felt uneasy. He did not know what Gallagher meant to tell
      him, but he was uncomfortably conscious that the day of the
      Lord-Lieutenant&rsquo;s visit might be a highly inconvenient time for proving
      his devotion to the cause of the people. The worst of devotion to any
      cause is that it makes demands on the devotee at moments when it is most
      difficult to fulfil them. Father McCormack tried feebly to put off the
      evil hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow, Thady, to-morrow,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t time now. It&rsquo;s
      half-past eleven, and the Lord-Lieutenant may be here any minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Begging your reverence&rsquo;s pardon,&rdquo; said Gallagher firmly, &ldquo;but to-morrow
      will be too late. The insult that is about to be offered to the people of
      this locality will be offered to-day if a stop&rsquo;s not put to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, Thady, nonsense, nobody is going to insult us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t know about it,&rdquo; said Gallagher, &ldquo;for you&rsquo;d be the last man
      they&rsquo;d dare to tell, knowing well that you&rsquo;d be as angry as I am myself.
      Do you know what the tune is that the doctor has taught to the band?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father McCormack did know, but he was very unwilling to enter into a
      discussion of the subject with Gallagher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Constable Moriarty,&rdquo; said Gallagher, &ldquo;is after telling me the name of the
      tune, and you&rsquo;d be surprised, so you would, if you heard it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may be mistaken, Thady, you may be mistaken. One tune&rsquo;s very like
      another when it&rsquo;s played on a band.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not mistaken,&rdquo; said Gallagher, who was beginning to feel suspicious
      about the priest&rsquo;s evident desire to shelve the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And anyway,&rdquo; said Father McCormack, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s Dr. O&rsquo;Grady himself that you&rsquo;d
      better be speaking to about the tune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will speak to him; but he&rsquo;s not here presently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try Doyle then,&rdquo; said Father McCormack. &ldquo;There he is coming out of the
      hotel. I haven&rsquo;t time to go into the matter. I want to go over and look at
      Mary Ellen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He slipped away as he spoke, leaving Gallagher standing, sulky and very
      suspicious, by himself. Doyle, who had no reason to think that anything
      had gone wrong, greeted him heartily. Gallagher replied angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what tune it is that the band&rsquo;s going to play?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You and your old tune!&rdquo; said Doyle. &ldquo;You had the life plagued out of me
      about that tune. Can&rsquo;t you let it alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not let it alone, for&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it that you were talking to the priest about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it might have been,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;by the look of him. Why can&rsquo;t
      you have sense, Thady, instead of tormenting the whole town about a tune?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my belief,&rdquo; said Gallagher, &ldquo;that he knows more about the tune than
      he&rsquo;d care to own up to. He and the doctor is in the conspiracy together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not stand here listening to you talking disrespectfully about the
      clergy,&rdquo; said Doyle with a fine show of indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt that he was on doubtful ground in discussing the tune, which
      might, for all he knew, be an objectionable one. It was a satisfaction to
      be able to put himself definitely in the right by protesting against
      Gallagher&rsquo;s tendency to anti-clericalism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be the last man in Ireland,&rdquo; said Gallagher, &ldquo;that would say a word
      against the clergy, but when we get Home Rule&mdash;and that won&rsquo;t be long
      now, please God&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused impressively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;what&rsquo;ll you do to the clergy when you get Home Rule?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s some of them that will be put in their places mighty quick, them
      that&rsquo;s opposing the will of the people of Ireland behind their backs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you mean Father McCormack, Thady, you&rsquo;d better go home before you&rsquo;ve
      said what you&rsquo;ll be sorry for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not go home till I&rsquo;ve told the doctor what I think of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, go and see him,&rdquo; said Doyle. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s in his house. When you come back
      you can tell me what he says to you. That&rsquo;ll be better worth hearing than
      anything you&rsquo;re likely to say to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doyle looked round with an air of some satisfaction when Gallagher left
      him. He had no doubt that Dr. O&rsquo;Grady would be able to deal satisfactorily
      with the difficulty about the tune. Everything else seemed to be going
      well. A considerable number of people had already gathered in the square.
      The band stood ready to play. Father McCormack was apparently very much
      pleased with the appearance of Mary Ellen. Constable Moriarty was on guard
      over the statue, looking unusually stern. Sergeant Colgan had come out of
      the barrack and was exerting all his authority to keep back a number of
      small children who wanted to investigate Mary Ellen&rsquo;s costume. Every time
      any of them approached her with the intention of pulling her shawl or
      testing by actual touch the material of her skirt, Sergeant Colgan spoke
      majestically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get away out of that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Get along home out of that, the whole of
      yez.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The children did not, of course, obey him literally; but they always drew
      back from Mary Ellen when he spoke, and it was generally at least a minute
      before the boldest of them ventured to touch her again.
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Doyle&rsquo;s satisfaction did not last long. Major Kent drove into the town in
      his pony trap and pulled up opposite the statue. He called to Father
      McCormack, who had satisfied himself about Mary Ellen&rsquo;s appearance, and
      was prowling round the statue, making mild jokes about its ghostly
      appearance. Doyle detected a note of urgency in the Major&rsquo;s voice, and
      hurried across the square, reaching the pony trap just as Father McCormack
      did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I hear,&rdquo; said the Major, &ldquo;that the Lord-Lieutenant&rsquo;s not coming after
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment neither Father McCormack nor Doyle spoke at all. The rumour&mdash;it
      could be no more than a rumour&mdash;to which the Major referred was too
      terrible for immediate digestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t be sorry myself,&rdquo; said the Major, &ldquo;if he doesn&rsquo;t come. I&rsquo;ve
      always thought we were making fools of ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Doyle regained his power of speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lie,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and whoever told it to you is a liar. The
      Lord-Lieutenant can&rsquo;t not come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be a curious thing, so it will,&rdquo; said Father McCormack, &ldquo;if he
      doesn&rsquo;t, but I can&rsquo;t believe it. Who was it told you, Major, if you don&rsquo;t
      mind my asking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was Mr. Ford,&rdquo; said the Major. &ldquo;He was standing at his door as I drove
      past and he stopped me to say that he&rsquo;d just had a telegram from Dublin
      Castle&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; said Doyle. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe a word of it. That
      fellow Ford was against us all the time, and he&rsquo;s just saying this now to
      annoy us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seemed to believe it himself,&rdquo; said the Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the doctor?&rdquo; said Father McCormack. &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s any truth in it
      he&rsquo;ll be sure to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If so be that such a telegram was sent,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll be on account
      of something that fellow Ford has been doing. He was always against us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the doctor?&rdquo; said Father McCormack helplessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably bolted,&rdquo; said the Major. &ldquo;If Ford&rsquo;s news is true that&rsquo;s the only
      thing for the doctor to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was with me half-an-hour ago,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;taking a look round at the
      luncheon and the rest of it. He went away back to his house to clean
      himself. If he knew&mdash;&mdash;but he didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and see him at once,&rdquo; said Father McCormack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find that he&rsquo;s cut and run,&rdquo; said the Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t go, Father,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;for Thady Gallagher&rsquo;s just after
      going to him, and I see him coming back at the far end of the street this
      minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thady Gallagher pushed his way through the crowd which had gathered
      thickly at the lower end of the square. It was plain from the way he
      elbowed the people who stood in his way that he was in a very bad temper
      indeed. He strode up to the Major&rsquo;s trap and began to speak at the top of
      his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me tell you this, gentlemen,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;if you deserve the name of
      gentlemen, which you don&rsquo;t, that the conspiracy which you&rsquo;re engaged in
      for insulting the people of this district by means of a tune&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He appeared to be addressing himself particularly to Major Kent, whom he
      evidently regarded as, next to the doctor, the chief conspirator. The
      Major disliked being abused. He also shrank from complicated situations.
      He foresaw that an argument with Gallagher about a tune which might be
      played if the Lord-Lieutenant did not fail to keep his appointment, was
      likely to be a confused and highly complex business. He touched his pony
      with the whip and drove away in the direction of Doyle&rsquo;s yard, where he
      usually put up his trap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have sense, Thady,&rdquo; said Father McCormack appealingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not have sense,&rdquo; said Gallagher. &ldquo;Why would I have sense when&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you speak to the doctor?&rdquo; said Doyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not, but if I had&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Lord save us and deliver us,&rdquo; said Doyle in despair. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone, the
      way the Major said he would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo; said Gallagher. &ldquo;The doctor&rsquo;s shaving
      himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure of that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure. Didn&rsquo;t I go through the house till I found him? Didn&rsquo;t I open
      the door of the room he was in? Didn&rsquo;t I see him standing there with a
      razor in his hand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what did he say to you, Thady? Did he tell you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He told me to get along out of that,&rdquo; said Gallagher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s likely he&rsquo;d heard the news. He&rsquo;d never have said the like of that to
      you, Thady, if he hadn&rsquo;t been upset about something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;ll we do at all?&rdquo; said Doyle. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the statue to be paid for and
      the dress for Mary Ellen and the luncheon. It&rsquo;s ruined we&rsquo;ll be, for where
      will we get the money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had my mind made up,&rdquo; said Gallagher, &ldquo;to speak out plain to the doctor
      about the tune the band&rsquo;s to play. I had my mind made up to tell him
      straight what I thought of him. And to tell him what I thought of the
      whole of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be quiet, Thady,&rdquo; said Father McCormack. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s more than you will want to speak plain to the doctor,&rdquo; said Doyle
      in sudden anger. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s him that&rsquo;s got us into the trouble we&rsquo;re in. It&rsquo;s
      him that ought to be made to pay up what&rsquo;ll have to be paid; only he can&rsquo;t
      do it, for he owes more this minute than ever he&rsquo;ll pay. Tell me now,
      Thady, what you said to him. Tell me the language you used. It&rsquo;ll be some
      satisfaction to me to hear the words you said to the doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said nothing,&rdquo; said Gallagher. &ldquo;Is it likely I&rsquo;d speak the way I meant
      to a man with an open razor in his hand? I&rsquo;d have had my throat cut if I&rsquo;d
      said a word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gregg rode hurriedly into the market square on her bicycle, while
      Gallagher was making his confession. She wore a delicate and flimsy pink
      silk skirt, entirely unsuited for cycling. A very large hat, adorned with
      a wreath of pink roses, had been forced to the back of her head by the
      speed at which she rode, and was held there with much strain by two large
      pins. She had only one glove, and several hooks at the back of the upper
      part of her dress were unfastened. No one could doubt that Mrs. Gregg had
      left home before she was quite ready. No one could doubt that she had come
      into Ballymoy as fast as she could. She dismounted in front of Father
      McCormack and panted. She said &ldquo;Oh&rdquo; three times, and each time was
      prevented saying anything else by lack of breath. Then she caught sight of
      Major Kent, who was coming out of the hotel yard after stabling his pony.
      She let her bicycle fall at the feet of Father McCormack, and ran to the
      Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Oh! my husband&mdash;just told me&mdash;a telegram&mdash;isn&rsquo;t
      it frightful? What are we to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m rather glad myself,&rdquo; said the Major, &ldquo;but everybody else is making a
      fuss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doyle, Father McCormack and Gallagher followed Mrs. Gregg. Father
      McCormack, who was a chivalrous man even when agitated, picked up her
      bicycle and brought it with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it true, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;what we&rsquo;re after hearing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite true,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gregg. &ldquo;My husband had a telegram. So had Mr.
      Ford. And Mrs. Ford is so pleased. Oh, it&rsquo;s too much! But where&rsquo;s Dr.
      O&rsquo;Grady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everybody is asking that,&rdquo; said the Major. &ldquo;My own impression is that
      he&rsquo;s bolted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If only Dr. O&rsquo;Grady were here,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gregg, &ldquo;he might do something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing the doctor won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; said Gallagher, &ldquo;Lord-Lieutenant
      or no Lord-Lieutenant, he&rsquo;ll not have the town band playing the tune that
      he&rsquo;s after teaching young Kerrigan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doyle,&rdquo; said Major Kent, &ldquo;do you think you could get Thady Gallagher out
      of this? He&rsquo;s becoming a nuisance. Nobody&rsquo;s temper will stand a Home Rule
      speech at the present moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thady,&rdquo; said Doyle, persuasively, &ldquo;a drop of something to drink is what
      will suit you. The inside of your throat is dried up the same as if you&rsquo;d
      been eating lime on account of the rage that&rsquo;s in you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doyle was himself no less perplexed than everyone else. He was more
      acutely sensitive than anyone to the danger of financial disaster. But he
      was a man of cool judgment even in a crisis. He saw that Gallagher&rsquo;s
      presence was highly inconvenient.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bottle of porter, Thady,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;or maybe two, would do you good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gallagher made a strong effort to swallow, intending when he had done so
      to speak again. But the description Doyle gave of the inside of his throat
      and the thought of cool draughts of porter, had actually induced a very
      real dryness of his mouth. He turned doubtfully towards the hotel, walked
      a few steps and then stood still again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doyle caught a glimpse, through a momentary opening in the crowd, of Dr.
      O&rsquo;Grady, shaved, and very carefully dressed in a new grey tweed suit. He
      became more than ever anxious to get Gallagher into the hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you fancy a glass of whisky, Thady,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s in there for you
      and welcome. There&rsquo;ll be no tunes played here for the next half hour,
      anyway, so you needn&rsquo;t be afraid to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took Gallagher by the arm as he spoke and led him towards the hotel.
      Gallagher went at first with apparent reluctance, but as he got near the
      door his steps quickened. Doyle did not leave him till he handed him over
      to the care of the young man who stood behind the bar while Doyle himself
      was absent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. O&rsquo;Grady made his way through the crowd with gay confidence, smiling
      and nodding to his acquaintances as he went. The people had been slightly
      suspicious beforehand and feared that something had gone wrong with the
      arrangements for the day&rsquo;s entertainment. They were cheered, and their
      confidence was fully restored when they saw Dr. O&rsquo;Grady was not in the
      least depressed. He smiled at Mary Ellen as he passed her and winked at
      Constable Moriarty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gregg, as soon as she caught sight of him, rushed to meet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Dr. O&rsquo;Grady,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t it terrible? What are we to do? I
      wouldn&rsquo;t mind so much only that Mrs. Ford is delighted. But you&rsquo;ll be able
      to do something, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first thing to be done,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;is to stop those children
      pulling the clothes off Mary Ellen. Would you mind, Mrs. Gregg, just
      running over and setting her shawl straight? Fix it with a pin. It&rsquo;s
      horrid the way it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gregg went over to Mary Ellen. She was deeply interested in the
      girl&rsquo;s costume, and she still cherished a hope that Dr. O&rsquo;Grady might
      manage somehow, even without the Lord-Lieutenant, to arrange for a
      ceremonial unveiling of the statue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, O&rsquo;Grady,&rdquo; said Major Kent maliciously. &ldquo;I suppose we may as well
      take down that statue. It&rsquo;s no particular use where it is, and it doesn&rsquo;t
      seem likely to help you to plunder the public funds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There will have to be slight alteration in our plans,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady,
      &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t see any reason for postponing the unveiling of the statue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know that the Lord-Lieutenant&rsquo;s not coming?&rdquo; said Father
      McCormack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had a telegram from his private secretary,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;I must
      say I think he might have let us know a little sooner. I was out early and
      I didn&rsquo;t get the message till an hour ago. Where&rsquo;s Doyle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doyle&rsquo;s making Thady Gallagher drunk in the hotel,&rdquo; said the Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s much the best thing to do with Thady.
      But I wish he&rsquo;d be quick about it, for I want to speak to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here he is coming now,&rdquo; said Father McCormack.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doyle, who had himself taken half a glass of whisky, approached Dr.
      O&rsquo;Grady with great courage and determination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the Lord-Lieutenant isn&rsquo;t coming,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I can see by the look
      of you that you know he&rsquo;s not, who&rsquo;s going to pay for the statue and the
      rest of the foolishness you&rsquo;re after buying? That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d like to
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you fret about that, Doyle,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;That will be all
      right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can it?&rdquo; said Doyle. &ldquo;If the Lord-Lieutenant doesn&rsquo;t come, and he
      won&rsquo;t, who&rsquo;s going to give us the money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave that entirely in my hands,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be perfectly
      all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re always saying,&rdquo; said Doyle sulkily. &ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;ll be all
      right. It&rsquo;ll be all right.&rsquo; Haven&rsquo;t you been saying it to me for the last
      two years? &lsquo;All right,&rsquo; says you, and, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rsquo; whenever the
      money you owe me is mentioned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More shame for you then, Doyle, for mentioning it so often. I wouldn&rsquo;t
      say &lsquo;All right&rsquo; or anything else about it if you didn&rsquo;t force me to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m dead sick of your &lsquo;All rights&rsquo; anyway,&rdquo; said Doyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be quiet now,&rdquo; said Father McCormack. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t the doctor doing the best he
      can for you? Is it his fault that the Lord-Lieutenant isn&rsquo;t here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll only stop growling, Doyle, and co-operate with me in bringing
      off the day&rsquo;s entertainment successfully&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely to goodness, O&rsquo;Grady, you&rsquo;re not going on with the statue farce?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I am. The only chance we have now of getting the money&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a damned poor chance,&rdquo; said Doyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a remarkably good chance. Don&rsquo;t
      you see that if we unveil the statue successfully, in spite of the way,
      the really scandalous way, the Lord-Lieutenant has treated us&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wash my hands of the whole business,&rdquo; said the Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can wash them afterwards,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;but at present you&rsquo;ll
      stand in with the rest of us. After the way the Lord-Lieutenant has
      treated us over the statue he&rsquo;ll have to give us a rattling good pier. He
      won&rsquo;t be able to refuse. Oh, hang it! Here&rsquo;s Mrs. Gregg again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gregg had settled Mary Ellen&rsquo;s shawl. She had spoken sternly, with an
      authority borrowed from her husband&rsquo;s official position, to Sergeant
      Colgan. She was filled with curiosity and excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Someone must get her out of this,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t settle
      things with her babbling at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there was a chance that she&rsquo;d be wanting a drink,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;but
      them ones wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Gregg,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;excuse my mentioning it; but there are
      three hooks in the back of your blouse that aren&rsquo;t fastened. It&rsquo;s an
      awfully nice blouse, but as you have it on at present it&rsquo;s rather&mdash;rather&mdash;well
      dégagé.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I started in such a hurry,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gregg. &ldquo;The moment I heard&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you go into the hotel,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll find a
      looking-glass. You&rsquo;ll be able to inspect the bouquet too. It&rsquo;s in a jug of
      water under the counter in&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; You take her, Father
      McCormack, and find the bouquet for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father McCormack was not listening. He was looking at a large motor-car
      which had just drawn up at the far end of the street, leading into the
      square.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s him after all,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s who?&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, turning round.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd which was pressing round the statue began to edge away from it.
      Men were standing on tiptoe, straining their necks to see over their
      fellows&rsquo; heads. Everybody began to move towards the motorcar. A loud cheer
      burst from the people nearest to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s him sure enough,&rdquo; said Father McCormack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Lord-Lieutenant,&rdquo; said Doyle excitedly. &ldquo;Bedamn, but this is
      great! We&rsquo;ll be all right now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t possibly be the Lord-Lieutenant,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d never
      change his mind twice in the same morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A tall man, very well dressed in a long frock-coat and a shiny silk hat,
      stood up in the motor. The crowd cheered again with tumultuous enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be the Lord-Lieutenant,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gregg ecstatically. &ldquo;Oh, will
      someone please hook up my blouse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nobody else it could be,&rdquo; said Doyle. &ldquo;Come on now, till we go to
      meet him. Come on, Father. Come you, Major. Doctor, will you go first?
      It&rsquo;s you knows the proper way to speak to the likes of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Father McCormack had a strong sense of his own dignity, and was
      convinced that the Church had a right to precedence on all ceremonial
      occasions. He walked, hat in hand, towards the stranger in the motorcar.
      The people divided to let him pass. Major Kent and Doyle followed him. Dr.
      O&rsquo;Grady stood still. Mrs. Gregg ran over to Mary Ellen and begged her to
      hook up the back of the dégagé blouse. Young Kerrigan mustered the town
      band. The members had strayed a little through the crowd, but at the
      summons of their leader they gathered in a circle. Kerrigan looked eagerly
      at Dr. O&rsquo;Grady awaiting the signal to strike up &ldquo;Rule Britannia.&rdquo; Dr.
      O&rsquo;Grady, unable to make himself heard through the cheering of the people,
      signalled a frantic negative. The stranger stepped out of his motor-car.
      Father McCormack, bowing low, advanced to meet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my proud and pleasant duty,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to welcome your Excellency
      to Ballymoy, and to assure you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to see a gentleman called O&rsquo;Grady,&rdquo; said the stranger, &ldquo;a Dr.
      O&rsquo;Grady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s here, your Excellency,&rdquo; said Father McCormack, &ldquo;and there isn&rsquo;t a
      man in Ballymoy who&rsquo;ll be more pleased to see your Excellency than he
      will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not His Excellency. My name is Blakeney, Lord Alfred Blakeney. I&rsquo;m
      aide-de-camp to the Lord-Lieutenant, and I particularly want to see Dr.
      O&rsquo;Grady.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Lord Alfred Blakeney walked up the street and crossed the square with
      great dignity. He made no acknowledgment whatever of the cheers with which
      the people greeted him. They still thought that he was the
      Lord-Lieutenant, and, expectant of benefits of some sort, they shouted
      their best. He glanced at the veiled statue, but turned his eyes away from
      it immediately, as if it were something obscene or otherwise disgusting.
      He took no notice of Mary Ellen, though she smiled at him. Father
      McCormack and Doyle followed him, crestfallen. Major Kent, who seemed
      greatly pleased, also followed him. Half way across the square Lord Alfred
      Blakeney turned round and asked which was Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. Father McCormack
      pointed him out with deprecating eagerness, much as a schoolboy with
      inferior sense of honour when himself in danger of punishment, points out
      to the master the real culprit. Lord Alfred Blakeney&rsquo;s forehead wrinkled
      in a frown. His lips closed firmly. His whole face wore an expression of
      dignified severity, very terrible to contemplate. Dr. O&rsquo;Grady seemed
      entirely unmoved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m delighted to see you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;though we expected the
      Lord-Lieutenant. By the way, you&rsquo;re not the Lord-Lieutenant, are you, by
      any chance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Blakeney, Lord Alfred Blakeney.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was afraid you weren&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;Father McCormack and Doyle
      insisted that you were. But I knew that His Excellency must be a much
      older man. They couldn&rsquo;t very well make anybody of your age
      Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, though I daresay you&rsquo;d do very well, and
      deserve the honour quite as much as lots of people that get it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Alfred Blakeney had been at Eton as a boy and at Christchurch,
      Oxford, afterwards as a young man. He was a Captain in the Genadier
      Guards, and he was aide-de-camp to the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland. It
      seemed quite impossible that an Irish dispensary doctor could be trying to
      poke fun at him. He supposed that Dr. O&rsquo;Grady was lamentably ignorant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;at His Excellency&rsquo;s express command&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;We understand. You&rsquo;re his representative.
      He was pretty well bound to send somebody considering the way he&rsquo;s treated
      us, telegraphing at the last moment. We&rsquo;re quite ready to make excuses for
      him, of course, if he&rsquo;s got a sudden attack of influenza or anything of
      that sort. At the same time he ought to have come unless he&rsquo;s very bad
      indeed. However, as you&rsquo;re here, we may as well be getting on with the
      business. Where&rsquo;s Doyle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doyle was just behind him. He was, in fact, plucking at Dr. O&rsquo;Grady&rsquo;s
      sleeve. He leaned forward and whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak a word to the gentleman about the pier. He&rsquo;s a high up gentleman
      surely, and if you speak to him he&rsquo;ll use his influence with the
      Lord-Lieutenant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be quiet, Doyle,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;Go off and get the bouquet as quick
      as you can and give it to Mrs. Gregg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Alfred Blakeney, who had gasped with astonishment at the end of Dr.
      O&rsquo;Grady&rsquo;s last speech to him, recovered his dignity with an effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You evidently don&rsquo;t understand that I have come here, at the
      Lord-Lieutenant&rsquo;s express command&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said that before,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To ask for&mdash;in fact to demand an explanation of&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have thought that you&rsquo;d have offered some sort of explanation to
      us. After all, we&rsquo;ve been rather badly treated and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An explanation,&rdquo; said Lord Alfred sternly, &ldquo;if any explanation is
      possible, of the extraordinary hoax which you&rsquo;ve seen fit to play on His
      Excellency.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A group of spectators formed a circle round Dr. O&rsquo;Grady and Lord Alfred.
      Father McCormack, puzzled and anxious, stood beside Mrs. Gregg. The Major
      was at a little distance from them. Mary Ellen stood almost alone beside
      the statue. The children of the town, attracted by some new excitement,
      had left her, and in spite of Sergeant Colgan, were pushing their way
      towards Lord Alfred. Dr. O&rsquo;Grady looked round him and frowned at the
      people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he took Lord Alfred by the arm and led him away to a corner of the
      square near the police barrack where there were very few people.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we can talk in peace. It&rsquo;s impossible to discuss anything
      in the middle of a crowd. You seem to think that the Lord-Lieutenant has
      some sort of grievance against us. What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You surely understand that,&rdquo; said Lord Alfred, &ldquo;without my telling you.
      You&rsquo;ve attempted to play off an outrageous hoax on the Lord-Lieutenant of
      Ireland. At least that&rsquo;s my view of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite a mistaken one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Lord-Lieutenant himself hopes that there may be some other
      explanation. That is why he sent me down here. He wants to give you the
      chance of clearing yourselves if you can. I may say frankly that if he&rsquo;d
      asked my opinion I should&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d have put us in prison at once,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;and kept us
      there till we died. You&rsquo;d have been perfectly right. We&rsquo;d have deserved it
      richly if we really had&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you are prepared to offer an explanation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll explain anything you like,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ll only tell
      me what your difficulty is. Oh, hang it! Excuse me one moment. Here&rsquo;s that
      ass Doyle coming at us again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doyle had brought the bouquet out of the hotel and given it to Mrs. Gregg.
      He had warned Constable Moriarty not to allow the people to press against
      the statue. He was crossing the square in the direction of the police
      barrack when Dr. O&rsquo;Grady saw him and went to meet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;will you keep in mind what I was saying to you this
      minute about the pier? Get a promise of it out of the gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s utterly impossible for me,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;to do anything if you
      keep interrupting me every minute. I&rsquo;m in the middle of an extremely
      difficult negotiation, and unless I&rsquo;m allowed a free hand there&rsquo;ll
      certainly be no pier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s no pier,&rdquo; said Doyle angrily, &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll be the worse for you.
      Don&rsquo;t you forget, doctor, that you owe me a matter of £60, and if I&rsquo;m at
      the loss of more money over this statue&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Constable Moriarty&rsquo;s voice rang out across the square. He was speaking in
      very strident tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you stand back out of that?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What business have you there
      at all? Didn&rsquo;t I tell you a minute ago that you weren&rsquo;t to go near the
      statue?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. O&rsquo;Grady and Doyle turned round to see what was happening. A man from
      the crowd, a well-dressed man, had slipped past Constable Moriarty and
      reached the statue. He had raised the bottom of the sheet which covered it
      and was peering at the inscription on the pedestal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doyle,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the American again. That&rsquo;s Billing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bedamn!&rdquo; said Doyle excitedly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. It&rsquo;s him sure enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go and seize him. Take him into the hotel. Drag his subscription out of
      him if you have to use a knife to get it. Whatever happens don&rsquo;t let him
      go again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doyle realised what his duty was before Dr. O&rsquo;Grady had stopped speaking.
      He ran across the square to the statue. Mr. Billing, heedless of
      Moriarty&rsquo;s threats, was lifting the sheet still higher. He had read the
      inscription and wanted to inspect the statue itself. Doyle seized him by
      the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come you along with me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and come quiet if you don&rsquo;t want me to
      give you in charge of the police.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, watching from a distance, saw Mr. Billing marched off towards
      the hotel. Then he turned to Lord Alfred again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must apologize,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for running away from you like that. But we
      couldn&rsquo;t have talked with that fellow, Doyle, pestering us. You don&rsquo;t know
      Doyle, of course. If you did, and if you happened to owe him a little
      money you&rsquo;d realise how infernally persistent he can be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Alfred had also been watching the capture of Mr. Billing. He wanted
      to understand, if possible; what was going on round about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your friend doing with the other man?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only capturing him,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t feel any anxiety
      about that. The other man is an American and a thorough-paced swindler.
      Nothing will happen to him that he doesn&rsquo;t deserve. But we mustn&rsquo;t waste
      time. We&rsquo;ve still got to unveil the statue. You go on with what you were
      saying. You were just going to tell me what the Lord-Lieutenant&rsquo;s
      difficulty is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You invited His Excellency down here,&rdquo; said Lord Alfred, &ldquo;to unveil a
      statue&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right. And we have the statue ready. There it is.&rdquo; He pointed out
      the statue as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The statue,&rdquo; said Lord Alfred, &ldquo;purports to represent General John
      Regan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does represent him. There&rsquo;s no purporting about the matter. The
      General&rsquo;s name is on the pedestal. You&rsquo;ll see it yourself as soon as you
      unveil it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It now appears,&rdquo; said Lord Alfred coldly, &ldquo;that there never was such a
      person as General John Regan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well? Try and get along a little quicker. I don&rsquo;t see yet where the
      insult to the Lord-Lieutenant is supposed to come in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You asked the Lord-Lieutenant to unveil a faked-up statue, and you have
      the amazing assurance to say now that you don&rsquo;t see that you&rsquo;ve done
      anything wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there never was a General&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;that the Lord-Lieutenant supposed
      that the General really existed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he supposed it. How could there be a statue to him if he
      didn&rsquo;t? We all supposed it. It wasn&rsquo;t until His Excellency began to
      prepare the speech he was to make that we found out the truth. He wrote to
      the British Museum and to the Librarian at the Bodleian&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry he took all that trouble. We didn&rsquo;t expect anything of the
      sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you expect?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. A few words about the elevating nature of great works
      of art&mdash;particularly statues. You know the sort of thing I mean. How
      the English nation occupies the great position it does very largely
      because it flocks to the Royal Academy regularly every year. How the
      people of Ballymoy are opening up a new era for Ireland. But I needn&rsquo;t go
      on. You must have heard him making speeches scores of times. That was all
      we wanted, and if we&rsquo;d had the slightest idea that he was taking a lot of
      trouble to prepare a learned lecture we&rsquo;d have told him that he needn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how could he make any speech about a General who never existed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Lord Alfred! What has the General got to do with it? We didn&rsquo;t
      want a speech about him. We wanted one about his statue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it isn&rsquo;t his statue. If there was no General there can&rsquo;t be a statue
      to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no use flying in the face of facts.
      The statue&rsquo;s under that sheet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not. I mean to say that there may be a statue there, but it&rsquo;s not to
      General John Regan. How can there be a statue to him when there was no
      such person?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was there ever such a person as Venus?&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t.
      And yet every museum in Europe is half full of statues of her. Was there
      ever such a person as the Dying Gladiator? Was there ever a man called
      Laocoon, who strangled sea serpents? You know perfectly well that there
      weren&rsquo;t any such people, and yet some of the most famous statues in the
      world are erected in memory of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But His Excellency naturally thought&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;if we&rsquo;d asked him to unveil a statue of
      Hercules in Ballymoy, would he have gone round consulting the librarians
      of London and Oxford to find out whether there was such a person as
      Hercules or not? Would he have said he was insulted? Would he have sent
      you here to ask for an apology? You know perfectly well he wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Alfred seemed slightly puzzled. Dr. O&rsquo;Grady&rsquo;s line of argument was
      quite new to him. He felt sure that a fallacy underlay it somewhere, but
      he could not at the moment see what the fallacy was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The case of Hercules is quite different,&rdquo; he said feebly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not in the least different. It&rsquo;s exactly the same. There was no such
      person as Hercules. Yet there are several statues of him. There was no
      such person as our General, but there may be lots of statues to him.
      There&rsquo;s certainly one. There&rsquo;s probably at least another. I should think
      the people of Bolivia are sure to have one. We&rsquo;ll ask Billing when we see
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he the priest who mistook me for the Lord-Lieutenant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no. He&rsquo;s the swindler whom Doyle caught. By the way, here&rsquo;s Doyle
      coming out of the hotel again. Do you mind if I call him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doyle crossed the square very slowly, because he stopped frequently to
      speak to the people whom he saw. He stopped when he came to Father
      McCormack and whispered something to him. He stopped when he came to Major
      Kent. He stopped for a moment beside Mrs. Gregg. He seemed to be full of
      some news and eager to tell it to everybody. When he saw Dr. O&rsquo;Grady
      coming to meet him he hurried forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have it safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cheque?&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better than that. Notes. Bank of Ireland notes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;Then it won&rsquo;t make so much matter if we don&rsquo;t
      get the pier. I&rsquo;m having a hard job with Lord Alfred. It appears that the
      Lord-Lieutenant is in a pretty bad temper, and it may not be easy to get
      the pier. However, I&rsquo;ll do my best. I wish you&rsquo;d go and fetch the
      illuminated address. Is Thady Gallagher safe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s making a speech this minute within, in the bar, and Mr. Billing&rsquo;s
      listening to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good. Get the illuminated address for me now as quick as you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doyle hurried off in the direction of the hotel. Dr. O&rsquo;Grady turned once
      more to Lord Alfred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;before we go on with the unveiling of the statue
      would you mind telling me this: Have you got an ear for music?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Alfred had recovered a little from the bewildering effect of Dr.
      O&rsquo;Grady&rsquo;s argument. He reminded himself that he had a duty to perform. He
      regained with an effort his original point of view, and once more felt
      sure that the Lord-Lieutenant had been grossly insulted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve listened to all you have to say,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I still feel, in
      fact I feel more strongly than ever, that an apology is due to His
      Excellency.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no objection whatever to apologising.
      I&rsquo;m extremely sorry that he was put to such a lot of unnecessary trouble.
      If I&rsquo;d had the least idea that he wouldn&rsquo;t have understood about the
      General&mdash;&mdash; but I thought he&rsquo;d have known. I still think he
      ought to have known. But I won&rsquo;t say a word about that. Tell him from me
      that I&rsquo;m extremely sorry. And now, have you an ear for music?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not an apology,&rdquo; said Lord Alfred. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t go back to His
      Excellency and tell him&mdash;&mdash; hang it! I can&rsquo;t tell him all that
      stuff about Venus and Hercules.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d tell me whether you have an ear for music or not. You don&rsquo;t
      understand the situation because you haven&rsquo;t met Thady Gallagher. But I
      can&rsquo;t ask you to unveil the statue until I know whether you&rsquo;ve an ear for
      music or not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. O&rsquo;Grady made a click with his tongue against the roof of his mouth. He
      was becoming very impatient.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Lord Alfred. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what business it is of
      yours whether I have or not; but anyhow, I haven&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None at all? You wouldn&rsquo;t know one tune from another?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I wouldn&rsquo;t. And now will you tell me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you anything you like when this business is over. I haven&rsquo;t
      time to enter into long explanations now. The people are beginning to get
      very impatient.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Young Kerrigan, with his bandsmen grouped around him, was standing a
      little below the police barrack. Dr. O&rsquo;Grady walked quickly over to him.
      He told him to be ready to begin to play the moment he received the
      signal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;&mdash; listen to me now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re to play some other
      tune, not the one I taught you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just as glad,&rdquo; said young Kerrigan. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s equal to me what tune I
      play, but Thady Gallagher&mdash;What tune will I play?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything you like,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;Whatever you know best, but not
      the one I taught you. Remember that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He left young Kerrigan, and hurried over to where Major Kent, Father
      McCormack and Mrs. Gregg were standing together near the statue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re now going to unveil the statue,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and everybody must be
      ready to do his part. Father McCormack, I want you to take charge of Mary
      Ellen. In the absence of the Lord-Lieutenant she&rsquo;ll pull the string.
      You&rsquo;re to see that she does it when I give the word. Then you must go
      across to the door of the hotel and keep a look out for Thady Gallagher.
      If he tries to make any sort of disturbance quell him at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m willing to try,&rdquo; said Father McCormack, &ldquo;and so far as Mary Ellen is
      concerned I&rsquo;m right enough. She&rsquo;s a good girl, and she&rsquo;ll do as I bid her.
      But it&rsquo;d take more than me to pacify Thady when he hears the band.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right about that the band won&rsquo;t play that tune at all. As it
      happens Lord Alfred has no ear whatever for music. That lets us out of
      what was rather an awkward hole. Young Kerrigan can play anything he
      likes, and so long as we all take off our hats, Lord Alfred&rsquo;ll think it&rsquo;s
      &lsquo;God Save the King.&rsquo; Thady won&rsquo;t be able to say a word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the way of it,&rdquo; said Father McCormack, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do the best I can
      with Thady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Gregg,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t present that bouquet, so the
      best thing for you to do is to step forward the moment the sheet drops off
      and deposit it at the foot of the statue. Major&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may leave me out,&rdquo; said Major Kent. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m merely a spectator.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll support Mrs. Gregg when she&rsquo;s paying her floral tribute to the
      memory of the dead General.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do no such thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must, Major. You can&rsquo;t let poor Mrs. Gregg go forward alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please do,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gregg. &ldquo;I shall be frightfully nervous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;hang it all, O&rsquo;Grady, how can I? What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s perfectly simple. Just walk forward beside her and smile. That&rsquo;s all
      that&rsquo;s wanted. The band will be playing at the time and nobody will notice
      you much. Now, I think everybody understands thoroughly what to do, and
      there&rsquo;s no reason why the proceedings shouldn&rsquo;t be a flaming success in
      spite of the conduct of the Lord-Lieutenant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about the Lord-Lieutenant?&rdquo; said Father McCormack. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be glad if I
      knew what the reason is of his not coming to us when he promised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The reason&rsquo;s plain enough,&rdquo; said the Major. &ldquo;He evidently has some common
      sense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a matter of fact,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;the exact contrary is the case.
      What Lord Alfred says is that he wouldn&rsquo;t come because he found out at the
      last moment that there was no such person as General John Regan. I don&rsquo;t
      call that sensible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was thinking all along,&rdquo; said Father McCormack, &ldquo;that there was
      something queer about the General.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Doyle came out of the hotel bringing the illuminated address. Dr. O&rsquo;Grady
      took it from him and carried it over to Lord Alfred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just take this,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Alfred looked at the address doubtfully. It was very large, and
      seemed an awkward thing to carry about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an illuminated address. We intended to present it to the
      Lord-Lieutenant, but of course we can&rsquo;t when he isn&rsquo;t here. You&rsquo;re to take
      it, and hand it over to him next time you see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pushed the address into Lord Alfred&rsquo;s arms as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many men would have made some resistance, would have put their hands into
      their pockets, perhaps, and so forced Dr. O&rsquo;Grady either to hold the frame
      himself or drop it on the ground. But Lord Alfred Blakeney had been
      aide-de-camp to the Lord-Lieutenant for several years. He knew something
      of the spirit which must animate all viceroys. It is their business to
      commend themselves, their office and the party which appoints them to the
      people over whom they reign. In private a Lord-Lieutenant with a sense of
      humour&mdash;no good Lord-Lieutenant ought to have a sense of humour&mdash;may
      mock at the things he has to do, but in public, however absurd the
      position in which he finds himself, he must remain gravely suave. His
      aides-de-camp must never under any circumstances do anything which could
      possibly cause offence to any part of the community. Dr. O&rsquo;Grady was
      certainly a very important and influential part of the community of
      Ballymoy. Lord Alfred allowed the illuminated address to be pushed into
      his arms. He attempted no more than a mild protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I lay it down somewhere?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so huge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better not. If you do it&rsquo;s sure to be forgotten, and then we&rsquo;ll have to
      forward it by post, which will involve us in a lot of extra expense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s so absurd to be lugging a great picture frame about in my arms
      all day, and I can&rsquo;t carry it any other way. It&rsquo;s too big.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, having made over the address to Lord Alfred, was not inclined
      to listen to any complaints about its size. He took off his hat and
      stepped forward towards the statue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The few people who could see Dr. O&rsquo;Grady stopped talking in order to hear
      what he was going to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he said again.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time, the nearer people having stopped talking, his voice carried
      further than it did at his first attempt. Very many more people turned
      round and began to listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      This third beginning secured him a large audience. Nearly half the people
      in the square were listening to him. He felt justified in going on with
      his speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we are now going to proceed with the
      unveiling of the statue of General John Regan. Mary Ellen, whom most of
      you know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused and the crowd cheered. A crowd nearly always cheers anyone who
      is mentioned by name in a speech, unless it is quite plain that the
      speaker means to be abusive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary Ellen,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;who is the nearest living relative of the
      great General, will perform the ceremony. Now, Mary Ellen,&rdquo; he went on, in
      a lower tone, &ldquo;pull the string. Father McCormack, give her the string. She
      doesn&rsquo;t seem able to find it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father McCormack handed the end of the string to Mary Ellen. She chucked
      at it in a timid, doubtful way. Nothing happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pull harder,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sergeant Colgan, who was a benevolent man, and therefore anxious that the
      ceremony should be a success, stepped to Mary Ellen&rsquo;s side and laid his
      hand on hers. He pulled hard. The sheet fluttered to the ground. The crowd
      cheered delightedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There now,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady to Lord Alfred Blakeney, &ldquo;I told you there
      really was a statue under that sheet. Next time I say something to you I
      hope you&rsquo;ll believe it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held up his hand, and young Kerrigan, who was watching for the signal,
      began to play at once. The tune he chose was an attractive one which had
      achieved some popularity in a Dublin pantomime the year before. Mrs. Gregg
      glanced dubiously at Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, and then walked towards the statue with
      the bouquet in her hand. When she had gone five or six yards she stopped
      and looked round to see what had happened to Major Kent. He was hanging
      back, but the piteous appeal in her eyes moved him. He scowled ferociously
      at the doctor, and then with clenched teeth and closely pressed lips
      joined Mrs. Gregg. Everybody cheered. The Major, in spite of being a
      landlord, was very popular in the neighbourhood. The cheers made him still
      more uncomfortable. He frowned with embarrassment and anger. Mrs. Gregg
      laid her hand on his arm. Still frowning, he led her forward, very much as
      if he were taking her in to dinner. Mrs. Gregg was frightened and nervous.
      She had only the vaguest idea of what she was expected to do. When she
      reached the base of the statue she curtseyed deeply. The people cheered
      frantically. Major Kent dropped her arm and hurried away. He was a
      gentleman of an old-fashioned kind, and, partly perhaps because he had
      never married, was very chivalrous towards women. But Mrs. Gregg&rsquo;s curtsey
      and the cheers which followed it were too much for him. His position had
      become intolerable. Mrs. Gregg, suddenly deserted by her escort, dropped
      the bouquet and fled. Sergeant Colgan picked it up and laid it solemnly at
      the foot of the statue. Young Kerrigan, stimulated by the cheers, worked
      the band up to a fortissimo performance of his tune.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. O&rsquo;Grady held his hat in his hand. He signalled frantically to Father
      McCormack. He took off his hat, whispering to Major Kent as he did so. The
      Major, who was utterly bewildered, and not at all sure what was happening,
      took off his hat. Several other bystanders, supposing that it must be
      right to stand bare-headed before a newly unveiled statue, took off
      theirs: Lord Alfred Blakeney looked round him doubtfully. Most of the
      people near him had their hats in their hands. He took off his.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unusually loud noise made by the band reached Thady Gallagher in the
      bar of the hotel. He stopped abruptly in the middle of a speech which he
      was making to Mr. Billing. After a moment&rsquo;s hesitation he rushed to the
      door of the hotel. The sight of the people, standing bare-headed and
      silent while the band played, convinced him that Dr. O&rsquo;Grady was in the
      act of perpetrating a treacherous trick upon the sincerely patriotic but
      unsuspecting inhabitants of Ballymoy. Standing at the door of the hotel he
      shouted and waved his arms. Mr. Billing stood behind him looking on with
      an expression of serious interest. Nobody could hear what Gallagher said.
      But Father McCormack and Doyle, fearing that he would succeed in making
      himself audible, hurried towards him. Doyle seized him by the arm,
      Gallagher shook him off angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It shall never be said,&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;that I stood silent while an insult
      was heaped upon Ballymoy and the cause of Nationalism in Ireland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whisht, now whisht,&rdquo; said Father McCormack. &ldquo;Sure there&rsquo;s nothing to be
      angry about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is what would make any man angry, any man that has the welfare of
      Ireland at heart. That tune&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t that tune at all,&rdquo; said Father McCormack. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s another one
      altogether.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not another,&rdquo; said Gallagher, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s the one I mean. Didn&rsquo;t
      Constable Moriarty say it was?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oughtn&rsquo;t you to listen to his reverence,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;more than to
      Moriarty? But if you won&rsquo;t do that, can&rsquo;t you hear the tune for yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can hear it; and what&rsquo;s more I can see the Major with his hat off and
      the young fellow that&rsquo;s down from Dublin Castle with his hat off, and the
      doctor&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my belief, Thady,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;that you&rsquo;re three parts drunk. It
      would be better for you to go back into the hotel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He caught Gallagher by the arm as he spoke and held him fast Young
      Kerrigan reached the end of his tune with a triumphant flourish. Dr.
      O&rsquo;Grady put on his hat again. One by one the various bystanders followed
      his example. Lord Alfred Blakeney looked round him, puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely that wasn&rsquo;t the National Anthem?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;that you didn&rsquo;t know one tune from
      another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t; but, hang it all, a man can&rsquo;t be aide-decamp to His Excellency
      without getting to know the sound of the National Anthem. What tune was it
      and why did we all take off our hats?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You tell the Lord-Lieutenant when you get back,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;that
      we all, including Major Kent, who&rsquo;s a strong Unionist, stood bare-headed
      while the band played. He&rsquo;ll be able to guess what tune it was, and he&rsquo;ll
      be pleased.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it wasn&rsquo;t the&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A speech will now be made,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, addressing the crowd, &ldquo;by
      Lord Alfred Blakeney as representative of the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; said Lord Alfred clutching at Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;His Excellency
      will be furious if he hears&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady pushing him towards the statue. &ldquo;Stand on the
      pedestal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t make a speech. I&rsquo;m not prepared. I&rsquo;ve nothing to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was pushed forward remorselessly. At the very base of the statue he
      turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope there are no reporters present,&rdquo; he said in a tone of despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There probably are lots,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;Get up now and begin. The
      people won&rsquo;t stand here all day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Alfred Blakeney, still clasping the illuminated address in his arms,
      was hustled on to the lowest step of the pedestal. The people cheered
      encouragingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh damn this great picture,&rdquo; said Lord Alfred. &ldquo;Do hold it for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind it,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right as it is. Make your
      speech.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen,&rdquo; said Lord Alfred, &ldquo;I find myself standing here
      to-day&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As representative of the Lord-Lieutenant,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, prompting
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not. I tell you he&rsquo;ll be angry. I can&rsquo;t make this speech. I
      really can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can if you like,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I stand here to-day,&rdquo; said Lord Alfred, &ldquo;at the unveiling of this
      beautiful statue&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear, hear,&rdquo; said Doyle from the door of the hotel. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a grand statue
      surely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing capitally. Say something about
      the grant from the Government for a new pier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About what?&rdquo; said Lord Alfred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About a grant for a new pier,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, speaking distinctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve no authority. I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;£500 will satisfy us,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mere trifle. After the
      shabby way the Lord-Lieutenant has behaved to us&mdash;but go on, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have much pleasure,&rdquo; said Lord Alfred Blakeney, &ldquo;in declaring this
      statue&mdash;er&mdash;open&mdash;er&mdash;for public inspection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The crowd cheered loudly. Dr. O&rsquo;Grady whispered to Lord Alfred that he
      ought to say something about the value of the statue as a work of art. But
      this time Lord Alfred&rsquo;s will was stronger than the doctor&rsquo;s. He jumped off
      the pedestal and flatly declined to mount it again. He was crimson in the
      face with mortification and embarrassment. Then, when the cheering
      subsided a little, Mr. Billing&rsquo;s voice was heard, clear and incisive. He
      had pushed his way from the door of the hotel and was standing near the
      statue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a darned poor speech,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is extraordinary how close the primitive barbarian is to the most
      civilised man. No one could have been more carefully trained than Lord
      Alfred Blakeney. No one possessed more of that suave self-control which
      distinguishes a man of the governing classes from the members of the mob.
      Yet Lord Alfred collapsed suddenly under the strain to which he had been
      subjected. Mr. Billing&rsquo;s taunt threw him back to an earlier, a very early
      stage of development.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make a better one yourself, then,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;whoever you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make one that&rsquo;ll create a sensation, anyhow,&rdquo; said Mr. Billing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stepped jauntily up the two steps of the pedestal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Lord-Lieutenant, Right Reverend Sir, Ladies and Gentlemen,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Alfred Blakeney clutched Dr. O&rsquo;Grady by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not the Lord-Lieutenant,&rdquo; he said desperately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not even his representative. Do try to make him understand that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t in the least matter who you are,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady. &ldquo;Listen to
      the speech.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I first set eyes on this town a month ago I thought I had bumped up
      against a most dead-alive, god-forsaken, one-horse settlement that Europe
      could boast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The crowd, being as Gallagher always asserted intensely patriotic, was not
      at all pleased at this beginning. Several people groaned loudly. Mr.
      Billing listened to them with a bland smile. The people were still further
      irritated and began to boo. Thady Gallagher broke suddenly from Doyle&rsquo;s
      control, and rushed forward waving his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pull the Yank down out of that,&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;What right has he to be
      standing there maligning the people of Ireland?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father McCormack and Doyle were after him at once and closed on him, each
      of them grasping one of his swinging arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Behave yourself, Thady,&rdquo; said Father McCormack, &ldquo;behave yourself decent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it him that&rsquo;s paying for the statue,&rdquo; said Doyle, &ldquo;and hasn&rsquo;t he a
      right to say what he likes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Billing seemed quite unimpressed by Gallagher&rsquo;s fiery interruption. He
      smiled benevolently again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got bitten with the notion of speeding you up a bit,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;because
      I felt plumb sure that there wasn&rsquo;t a live man in the place, nothing but a
      crowd of doddering hop-toads.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hop-toad is a reptile unknown in Ireland, but its name sounds
      disgusting. The crowd began to get very angry, and surged threateningly
      towards the platform. Sergeant Colgan felt that a great opportunity had
      arrived. He had all his life been looking for a chance of quelling a riot.
      He had it at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep back, now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;keep back out of that. Do you want me to draw
      my baton to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Mr. Billing, &ldquo;I was mistaken and I own up. There
      is one live man in Ballymoy anyway. We haven&rsquo;t got a medical gentleman on
      our side of the Atlantic equal to Dr. Lucius O&rsquo;Grady. He has run this show
      in a way that has surprised me considerable. He has erected a statue that
      will be an ornament to this town, and it&rsquo;s a pleasure to me to pay for
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear, hear,&rdquo; shouted Doyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd, which had been booing a minute before, cheered heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s fetched down the representative of the Lord-Lieutenant of this
      country to unveil the statue!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; said Lord Alfred feebly. &ldquo;I wish I could get you to understand
      that I&rsquo;m not his representative.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His protest was lost in a fresh burst of cheers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has provided a charming grand-niece,&rdquo; said Mr. Billing, &ldquo;a grand-niece
      that any man, living or dead, might be proud of&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get out,&rdquo; said Mary Ellen softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For General John Regan,&rdquo; said Mr. Billing amidst tumultuous cheers, &ldquo;and
      when I tell you that no such General ever existed in Bolivia or anywhere
      else, you&rsquo;ll be in a position to appreciate your doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doyle dropped Gallagher&rsquo;s arm and rushed forward. The crowd, too,
      astonished by Mr. Billing&rsquo;s last words, even to cheer, stood silent. What
      Doyle said was plainly heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be damn, doctor, but you&rsquo;re great, and I&rsquo;d say that if it was the last
      word ever I spoke. Ask him for the price of the new pier now and he&rsquo;ll
      give it to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said Mr. Billing, &ldquo;if 2,000 dollars will build the pier Mr.
      Doyle wants, I&rsquo;ll give it with pleasure, and I reckon that the show which
      Dr. O&rsquo;Grady has run is cheap at the price.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sergeant Colgan stepped forward with slow dignity. He beckoned to
      Constable Moriarty. His face wore an expression of steady determination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be better, doctor,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you and the other gentlemen
      present would move away. The demeanour of the crowd is threatening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The demeanour of the crowd was, in fact, hilarious; but Dr. O&rsquo;Grady
      understood that there are limits to the patience of the official guardians
      of law and order. The police&mdash;the fact is exemplified in their
      occasional dealings with the students of Trinity College&mdash;appreciate
      a joke as well as any men, and up to a certain point are tolerant of
      merriment. But it is possible to go too far, and there is a point at which
      fooling becomes objectionable. Dr. O&rsquo;Grady took Mr. Billing by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and let us have a drink of some sort, and
      something to eat. There&rsquo;s no reason why we shouldn&rsquo;t have something to
      eat. Doyle has a magnificent luncheon spread out in his hotel. Run in
      Doyle, and tell the cook to dish up the potatoes. Major, you bring Mrs.
      Gregg along with you. I&rsquo;m sure Mrs. Gregg wants something to eat. Lord
      Alfred, I&rsquo;m sorry we haven&rsquo;t a lady for you to take in, but Father
      McCormack will show you the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If this business gets into the papers,&rdquo; said Lord Alfred, &ldquo;the <i>Freeman&rsquo;s
      Journal</i> will make capital of it, and the <i>Irish Times</i> will say
      the Government must resign at once. Can&rsquo;t we square the reporters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t any,&rdquo; said Dr. O&rsquo;Grady, &ldquo;unless Gallagher&rsquo;s been taking
      notes. Come along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The party, Doyle at the head of it, passed into the hotel. Sergeant Colgan
      turned and faced the crowd. His hand was on the baton at his side. His
      face and attitude were majestic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get along home now, every one of yous,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get along out of that!&rdquo; said Constable Moriarty.
    </p>
    <p>
      In twos and threes, in little groups of ten and twelve, silently obedient,
      the crowd slunk away. The statue of General John Regan was left looking
      down upon an empty market place. So the last word is spoken in the
      pleasant drama of Irish life. The policeman speaks it. &ldquo;Get along home out
      of that, every one of you.&rdquo; So the curtain drops on our performances. In
      spite of our whirling words we bow to, in the end, the voice of authority.
    </p>

      THE END <br /><br />
